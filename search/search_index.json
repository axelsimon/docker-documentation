As the projects that we package and distribute grow, conventionally so do the use cases along with large communities of power users. As it has become very difficult for us to support Swiss Army Knife style images we are looking to the community of users to start customizing our base image layer themselves. Something we provide and pride ourselves on is keeping our containers up to date with not only the latest external software releases, but also with the latest distribution level packages. Conventionally when people needed some form of custom functionality they would fork our source and build something once that suited their needs leaving this dangling fork without updates or basic maintenance. Behind the scenes we have been working to provide the community with the ability to customize our images not only for themselves but also for other users. This comes in the form of 3 different tools: Private Custom Scripts Private Custom Services Public Facing Docker Mods All of the functionality described in this post is live on every one of the containers we currently maintain: https://fleet.linuxserver.io NOTE: While the following support has been added to our containers, we will not give support to any custom scripts, services, or mods. If you are having an issue with one of our containers, be sure to disable all custom scripts/services/mods before seeking support. Custom Scripts The first part of this update is the support for a user's custom scripts to run at startup. In every container, simply create a new folder located at /custom-cont-init.d and add any scripts you want. These scripts can contain logic for installing packages, copying over custom files to other locations, or installing plugins. Because this location is outside of /config you will need to mount it like any other volume if you wish to make use of it. e.g. -v /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-files:/custom-cont-init.d if using the Docker CLI or services: bar: volumes: - /home/foo/appdata/bar:/config - /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-files:/custom-cont-init.d:ro if using compose. Where possible, to improve security, we recommend mounting them read-only ( :ro ) so that container processes cannot write to the location. One example use case is our Piwigo container has a plugin that supports video, but requires ffmpeg to be installed. No problem. Add this bad boy into a script file (can be named anything) and you're good to go. #!/bin/bash echo \"**** installing ffmpeg ****\" apk add --no-cache ffmpeg NOTE: The folder /custom-cont-init.d needs to be owned by root! If this is not the case, this folder will be renamed and a new (empty) folder will be created. This is to prevent remote code execution by putting scripts in the aforementioned folder. Custom Services There might also be a need to run an additional service in a container alongside what we already package. Similarly to the custom scripts, just create a new directory at /custom-services.d . The files in this directory should be named after the service they will be running. Similar to with custom scripts you will need to mount this folder like any other volume if you wish to make use of it. e.g. -v /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-services:/custom-services.d if using the Docker CLI or services: bar: volumes: - /home/foo/appdata/bar:/config - /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-services:/custom-services.d:ro if using compose. Where possible, to improve security, we recommend mounting them read-only ( :ro ) so that container processes cannot write to the location. Running cron in our containers is now as simple as a single file. Drop this script in /custom-services.d/cron and it will run automatically in the container: #!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash /usr/sbin/crond -f -S -l 0 -c /etc/crontabs NOTE: With this example, you will most likely need to have cron installed via a custom script using the technique in the previous section, and will need to populate the crontab. NOTE: The folder /custom-services.d needs to be owned by root! If this is not the case, this folder will be renamed and a new (empty) folder will be created. This is to prevent remote code execution by putting scripts in the aforementioned folder. Docker Mods In most cases if you needed to write some kind of custom logic to get a plugin to work or to use some kind of popular external service you will not be the only one that finds this logic useful. If you would like to publish and support your hard work we provide a system for a user to pass a single environment variable to the container to ingest your custom modifications. We consume Mods from Dockerhub and in order to publish one following our guide, you only need a Github Account and a Dockerhub account. (Our guide and example code can be found here) Essentially it is a system that stashes a tarball of scripts and any other files you need in an image layer on Dockerhub. When we spin up the container we will download this tarball and extract it to /. This allows community members to publish a relatively static pile of logic that will always be applied to an end user's up to date Linuxserver.io container. An example of how this logic can be used to greatly expand the functionality of our base containers would be to add VPN support to a Transmission container: docker create \\ --name=transmission \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e DOCKER_MODS=taisun/config-mods:pia \\ -e PIAUSER=pmyuser \\ -e PIAPASS=mypassword \\ -e PIAENDPOINT=\"US New York City\" \\ -e TZ=US/Eastern \\ -p 9091:9091 \\ -p 51413:51413 \\ -p 51413:51413/udp \\ -v path to data:/config \\ -v path to downloads:/downloads \\ -v path to watch folder:/watch \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/transmission The source code for this mod can be found here .

Key Terminology There are a few terms you might find useful to understand when working with containers: docker - the first, and most popular, container runtime - it sits as an abstraction layer between the kernels features such as cgroups or namespaces and running applications container - a sandboxed process isolated in memory and running instance of an image image - a pre-built filesystem in a format ready to be understood by a container runtime (usually docker) volume - use volumes to persist data outside of the containers sandboxed filesystem environment - a way of configuring the sandboxed environment your container runs in Key Concepts Containers are completely sandboxed environments by the Linux kernel. It may help you to think of them somewhat like a small VM however in practice this is largely false. The Linux kernel controls access to various system resources utilising control groups (cgroups). We rely on docker to translate these complex concepts into simple ones that users can understand and consume. By default a running container has absolutely no context of the world around it. Out the box you cannot connect from the outside world to the running webservers on ports 80 and 443 below. To allow entry to the sandbox from the outside world we must explicitly allow entry using the -p flag. docker run -d --name=letsencrypt -p 80:80 -p 443:443 linuxserver/letsencrypt Take this concept and multiply it across all aspects of a running application.

With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application\u2019s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Note that when inputting data for variables, you must follow standard YAML rules. In the case of passwords with special characters this can mean escaping them properly ($ is the escape character) or properly quoting the variable. The best course of action if you do not know how to do this or are unwilling to research, is to stick to alphanumeric characters only. Installation Install Option 1 (recommended): Starting with version 2, Docker started publishing docker compose as a go based plugin for docker (rather than a python based standalone binary). And they also publish this plugin for various arches, including x86_64, armhf and aarch64 (as opposed to the x86_64 only binaries for v1.X). Therefore we updated our recommended install option to utilize the plugin. You can install docker compose via the following commands: ARCH=$(uname -m) && [[ \"${ARCH}\" == \"armv7l\" ]] && ARCH=\"armv7\" sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins sudo curl -SL \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-linux-${ARCH}\" -o /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose sudo chmod +x /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose Assuming you already have docker (or at the very least docker-cli) installed, preferably from the official docker repos, running docker compose version should display the compose version. If you don't have docker installed yet, we recommend installing it via the following commands: curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sh get-docker.sh v1.X compatibility: As v2 runs as a plugin instead of a standalone binary, it is invoked by docker compose args instead of docker-compose args . There are also some slight differences in how the yaml is operated as well. To make migration easier, Docker released a replacement binary for docker-compose on x86_64 and aarch64 platforms. More info on that can be found at the upstream repo . Install Option 2: You can install docker-compose using our docker-compose image via a run script. You can simply run the following commands on your system and you should have a functional install that you can call from anywhere as docker-compose : sudo curl -L --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-docker-compose/v2/run.sh -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose In order to update the local image, you can run the following commands: docker pull linuxserver/docker-compose:\"${DOCKER_COMPOSE_IMAGE_TAG:-v2}\" docker image prune -f The above commands will use the v2 images (although invoked by docker-compose instead of docker compose ). If you'd like to use v1 images, you can set an env var DOCKER_COMPOSE_IMAGE_TAG=alpine , DOCKER_COMPOSE_IMAGE_TAG=ubuntu in your respective .profile . Alternatively you can set that var to a versioned image tag like v2-2.4.1-r1 or version-alpine-1.27.4 to pin it to a specific docker-compose version. Single service Usage Here's a basic example for deploying a Linuxserver container with docker compose: version: \"2.1\" services: heimdall: image: linuxserver/heimdall container_name: heimdall volumes: - /home/user/appdata/heimdall:/config environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London ports: - 80:80 - 443:443 restart: unless-stopped If you save the above snippet in a file named docker-compose.yml , you can simply run docker compose up -d from within the same folder and the heimdall image will be automatically pulled, and a container will be created and started. up means bring the services up, and -d means do it in the background. If you want to do it from a different folder or if you named the yaml file differently, ie. heimdall.yml , then you can define it in the command with -f : docker compose -f /path/to/heimdall.yml up -d To bring down the services, simply do docker compose down or docker compose -f /path/to/heimdall.yml down and all containers defined by the yml will be stopped and destroyed. Multiple Service Usage You can have multiple services managed by a single compose yaml. Copy the contents below the services: line in any of our readme yaml samples into the same yaml file and the docker compose up/down commands will apply to all services at once. Let's say you have the following in a yaml file named docker-compose.yml : version: \"2.1\" services: heimdall: image: linuxserver/heimdall container_name: heimdall volumes: - /home/user/appdata/heimdall:/config environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London ports: - 80:80 - 443:443 restart: unless-stopped nginx: image: linuxserver/nginx container_name: nginx environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /home/user/appdata/nginx:/config ports: - 81:80 - 444:443 restart: unless-stopped mariadb: image: linuxserver/mariadb container_name: mariadb environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ROOT_ACCESS_PASSWORD - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /home/user/appdata/mariadb:/config ports: - 3306:3306 restart: unless-stopped You now have 3 services defined in there: heimdall , nginx and mariadb . When you do a docker compose up -d , it will first download the images for all three if they don't exist (if they exist, they are not updated) and it will create all three containers and start them. docker compose down will bring all three services down and destroy the containers (persistent data will remain). Updates If you want to update the images and recreate the containers with the same vars, it's extremely easy with docker-compose. First we tell it to update all images via docker compose pull . Then we issue docker compose up -d and it will automatically recreate the containers (as necessary) based on the updated images. If a container's image is already the latest and there was no update, it remains untouched. Similarly, if you edit the contents of the yaml file and re-issue docker compose up -d , only the containers affected by the changes to the yaml file will be recreated, others will be untouched. Defining the containers running on your server as code is a core tenet of a \"Devops\" approach to the world. Constructing elaborate docker run commands and then forgetting which variables you passed is a thing of the past when using docker compose . Support Requests If you would like to request support, you can do so on our forum or on our discord server . When you do so, please provide all the necessary information like the server and platform info, docker container log and the compose yaml. If your compose yaml makes use of .env , please post an output of docker compose convert or docker compose convert -f /path/to/compose.yml for the entire yaml, or docker compose convert <service name> for a single service, as it will automatically replace the environment variables with their actual values. Tips & Tricks docker compose expects a docker-compose.yml file in the current directory and if one isn't present it will complain. In order to improve your quality of life we suggest the use of bash aliases. The file path for the aliases below assumes that the docker-compose.yml file is being kept in the folder /opt . If your compose file is kept somewhere else, like in a home directory, then the path will need to be changed. Create or open the file ~/.bash_aliases and populate with the following content: alias dcup='docker compose -f /opt/docker-compose.yml up -d' #brings up all containers if one is not defined after dcup alias dcdown='docker compose -f /opt/docker-compose.yml stop' #brings down all containers if one is not defined after dcdown alias dcpull='docker compose -f /opt/docker-compose.yml pull' #pulls all new images is specified after dcpull alias dclogs='docker compose -f /opt/docker-compose.yml logs -tf --tail=\"50\" ' alias dtail='docker logs -tf --tail=\"50\" \"$@\"' If the docker-compose.yml file is in a home directory, the following can be put in the ~/.bash_aliases file. alias dcup='docker-compose -f ~/docker-compose.yml up -d' #brings up all containers if one is not defined after dcup alias dcdown='docker-compose -f ~/docker-compose.yml stop' #brings down all containers if one is not defined after dcdown alias dcpull='docker-compose -f ~/docker-compose.yml pull' #pulls all new images unless one is specified alias dclogs='docker-compose -f ~/docker-compose.yml logs -tf --tail=\"50\" ' alias dtail='docker logs -tf --tail=\"50\" \"$@\"' There are multiple ways to see the logs of your containers. In some instances, using docker logs is preferable to docker compose logs . By default docker logs will not run unless you define which service the logs are coming from. The docker compose logs will pull all of the logs for the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. When asking for help, you should post your logs or be ready to provide logs if someone requests it. If you are running multiple containers in your docker-compose.yml file, it is not helpful to submit all of the logs. If you are experiencing issues with a single service, say Heimdall, then you would want to get your logs using docker logs heimdall or docker compose logs heimdall . The bash_alias for dclogs can be used if you define your service after you've typed the alias. Likewise, the bash_alias detail will not run without defining the service after it. Some distributions, like Ubuntu, already have the code snippet below in the ~/.bashrc file. If it is not included, you'll need to add the following to your ~/.bashrc file in order for the aliases file to be picked up: if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then . ~/.bash_aliases fi Once configured, you can run source ~/.bashrc or log out and the log in again.

It will synchronize with Docker Hub over a set interval in order to update its stored data. It then displays this snapshot data on its own status page as a useful list, containing links to each repository and image owned by the repository owner. Each image also contains a status which is managed by the repository owner, who can define images as either Stable or Unstable . This is designed to quickly help users know when an image is undergoing a state of instability which is known by the owner. Why a snapshot? In short, Docker Hub's API is very slow. It would not be a good long-term solution to just proxy the responses from Docker Hub and translate the data into something considered useful by downstream clients. By caching the image information in its own database, Fleet is able to more efficiently return the status data for each image and repository. In doing so, it is also able to provide more concise data, such as image versions, as part of the primary response, rather than requiring users to make a separate call.

This is beneficial for two main reasons: A common dependency base between multiple images, reducing the likelihood of variation between two or more applications that share the same dependencies. Reduction in image footprint on your host machine by fully utilising Docker's image layering system. Multiple containers running locally that share the same base image will reuse that image and any of its ancestors. The /config volume To help reduce variation between our images, we have adopted a common structure pattern for application config and dependent directories. This means that each image has its own internal /config directory which holds all application-specific configuration.

SSL certs allow users of a service to communicate via encrypted data transmitted up and down. Third party trusted certs also allow users to make sure that the remote service they are connecting to is really who they say they are and not someone else in the middle. When we run a web server for reasons like hosting websites or reverse proxying services on our own domain, we need to set it up with third party trusted ssl certs so client browsers trust it and communicate with it securely. When you connect to a website with a trusted cert, most browsers show a padlock icon next to the address bar to indicate that. Without a trusted cert (ie. with self signed cert) most browsers show warning pages or may block access to the website as the website identity cannot be confirmed via a trusted third party. What is Let's Encrypt (and/or ZeroSSL)? In the past, the common way to get a trusted ssl cert was to contact one of the providers, send them the relevant info to prove ownership of a domain and pay for the service. Nowadays, with Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL , one can get free certs via automated means. The SWAG docker image , published and maintained by LinuxServer.io , makes setting up a full-fledged web server with auto generated and renewed ssl certs very easy. It is essentially an nginx webserver with php7, fail2ban (intrusion prevention) and Let's Encrypt cert validation built-in. It is just MySQL short of a LEMP stack and therefore is best paired with our MariaDB docker image . Creating a SWAG container Most of the initial settings for getting a webserver with ssl certs up are done through the docker run/create or compose yaml parameters. Here's a list of all the settings available including the optional ones. It is safe to remove unnecessary parameters for different scenarios. docker cli docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=yourdomain.url \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=www, \\ -e VALIDATION=http \\ -e CERTPROVIDER= `#optional` \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare `#optional` \\ -e DUCKDNSTOKEN=<token> `#optional` \\ -e EMAIL=<e-mail> `#optional` \\ -e ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false `#optional` \\ -e EXTRA_DOMAINS=<extradomains> `#optional` \\ -e STAGING=false `#optional` \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 `#optional` \\ -v </path/to/appdata/config>:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag docker-compose Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas. --- version: \"2.1\" services: swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=yourdomain.url - SUBDOMAINS=www, - VALIDATION=http - CERTPROVIDER= #optional - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare #optional - DUCKDNSTOKEN=<token> #optional - EMAIL=<e-mail> #optional - ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false #optional - EXTRA_DOMAINS=<extradomains> #optional - STAGING=false #optional volumes: - </path/to/appdata/config>:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 #optional restart: unless-stopped Authorization method Our image currently supports three different methods to validate domain ownership: http: Let's Encrypt (acme) server connects to domain on port 80 Can be owned domain or a dynamic dns address dns: Let's Encrypt (acme) server connects to dns provider Api credentials and settings entered into ini files under /config/dns-conf/ Supports wildcard certs Need to have own domain name (non-free) duckdns: Let's Encrypt (acme) server connects to DuckDNS Supports wildcard certs (only for the sub-subdomains) No need for own domain (free) The validation is performed when the container is started for the first time. Nginx won't be up until ssl certs are successfully generated. The certs are valid for 90 days. The container will check the cert expiration status every night and if they are to expire within 30 days, it will attempt to auto-renew. If your certs are about to expire in less than 30 days, check the logs under /config/log/letsencrypt to see why the auto-renewals failed. Cert Provider (Let's Encrypt vs ZeroSSL) As of January 2021, SWAG supports getting certs validated by either Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL . Both services use the ACME protocol as the underlying method to validate ownership. Our Certbot client in the SWAG image is ACME compliant and therefore supports both services. Although very similar, ZeroSSL does (at the time of writing) have a couple of advantages over Let's Encrypt: * ZeroSSL provides unlimited certs via ACME and has no rate limits or throttling (it's quite common for new users to get throttled by Let's Encrypt due to multiple unsuccessful attempts to validate) * ZeroSSL provides a web interface that allows users to list and manage the certs they have received SWAG currently defaults to Let's Encrypt as the cert provider so as not to break existing installs, however users can override that behavior by setting the environment variable CERTPROVIDER=zerossl to retrieve a cert from ZeroSSL instead. The only gotcha is that ZeroSSL requires the EMAIL env var to be set so the certs can be tied to a ZeroSSL account for management over their web interface. Port forwards Port 443 mapping is required for access through https://domain.com . However, you don't necessarily need to have it listen on port 443 on the host server. All that is needed is to have port 443 on the router (wan) somehow forward to port 443 inside the container, while it can go through a different port on the host. For instance, it is ok to have port 443 on router (wan) forward to port 444 on the host, and then map port 444 to port 443 in docker run/create or compose yml. Port 80 forwarding is required for http validation only. Same rule as above applies, and it's OK to go from 80 on the router to 81 on the host, mapped to 80 in the container. Docker networking SWAG container happily runs with bridge networking. However, the default bridge network in docker does not allow containers to connect each other via container names used as dns hostnames. Therefore, it is recommended to first create a user defined bridge network and attach the containers to that network. If you are using docker-compose, and your services are on the same yaml, you do not need to do this, because docker-compose automatically creates a user defined bridge network and attaches each container to it as long as no other networking option is defined in their config. For the below examples, we will use a network named lsio . We can create it via docker network create lsio . After that, any container that is created with --net=lsio can ping each other by container name as dns hostname. Keep in mind that dns hostnames are meant to be case-insensitive, however container names are case-sensitive. For container names to be used as dns hostnames in nginx, they should be all lowercase as nginx will convert them to all lowercase before trying to resolve. Container setup examples Create container via http validation Let's assume our domain name is linuxserver-test.com and we would like our cert to also cover www.linuxserver-test.com and ombi.linuxserver-test.com . On the router, forward ports 80 and 443 to your host server. On your dns provider (if using your own domain), create an A record for the main domain and point it to your server IP (wan). Also create CNAMES for www and ombi and point them to the A record for the domain. With docker cli, we'll first create a user defined bridge network if we haven't already docker network create lsio , and then create the container: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=www,ombi \\ -e VALIDATION=http \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Once created, we do docker start swag to start it. With docker compose, we can use the following yml: --- version: \"2.1\" services: swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=www,ombi - VALIDATION=http volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped We can fire up the container with docker-compose up -d After the container is started, we'll watch the logs with docker logs swag -f . After some initial initialization, we will see the validation steps. After all the steps, it should print Server ready in the logs. Now we can browse to https://www.linuxserver-test.com and we'll see the default landing page displayed. Create container via dns validation with a wildcard cert Let's assume our domain name is linuxserver-test.com and we would like our cert to also cover www.linuxserver-test.com , ombi.linuxserver-test.com and any other subdomain possible. On the router, we'll forward port 443 to our host server (Port 80 forwarding is optional). We'll need to make sure that we are using a dns provider that is supported by this image. Currently the following dns plugins are supported: cloudflare , cloudxns , digitalocean , dnsimple , dnsmadeeasy , google , luadns , nsone , ovh , rfc2136 and route53 . Your dns provider by default is the provider of your domain name and if they are not supported, it is very easy to switch to a different dns provider. Cloudflare is recommended due to being free and reliable. To switch to Cloudflare, you can register for a free account and follow their steps to point the nameservers to Cloudflare. The rest of the instructions assume that we are using the cloudflare dns plugin. On our dns provider, we'll create an A record for the main domain and point it to our server IP (wan). We'll also create a CNAME for * and point it to the A record for the domain. On Cloudflare, we'll click on the orange cloud to turn it grey so that it is dns only and not cached/proxied by Cloudflare, which would add more complexities. Now, let's get the container set up. With docker cli, we'll first create a user defined bridge network if we haven't already docker network create lsio , and then create the container: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=dns \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag And we start the container via docker start swag With docker compose, we'll use: --- version: \"2.1\" services: swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=dns - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped Then we'll fire up the container via docker-compose up -d After the container is started, we'll watch the logs with docker logs swag -f . After some init steps, we'll notice that the container will give an error during validation due to wrong credentials. That's because we didn't enter the correct credentials for the Cloudflare api yet. We can browse to the location /config/dns-conf which is mapped from the host location (according to above settings) /home/aptalca/appdata/swag/dns-conf/ and edit the correct ini file for our dns provider. For Cloudflare, we'll enter our e-mail address and the api key. The api key can be retrieved by going to the Overview page and clicking on Get your API key link. We'll need the Global API Key . Once we enter the credentials into the ini file, we'll restart the docker container via docker restart swag and again watch the logs. After successful validation, we should see the notice Server ready and our webserver should be up and accessible at https://www.linuxserver-test.com . Create container via duckdns validation with a wildcard cert We will first need to get a subdomain from DuckDNS . Let's assume we get linuxserver-test so our url will be linuxserver-test.duckdns.org . Then we'll need to make sure that the subdomain points to our server IP (wan) on the DuckDNS website. We can always use our DuckDNS docker image to keep the IP up to date. Don't forget to get the token for your account from DuckDNS. On the router, we'll forward port 443 to our host server (Port 80 forward is optional). Now, let's get the container set up. With docker cli, we'll first create a user defined bridge network if we haven't already docker network create lsio , and then create the container: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.duckdns.org \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=duckdns \\ -e DUCKDNSTOKEN=97654867496t0877648659765854 \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag And we start the container via docker start swag With docker compose, we'll use: --- version: \"2.1\" services: swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.duckdns.org - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=duckdns - DUCKDNSTOKEN=97654867496t0877648659765854 volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped Then we'll fire up the container via docker-compose up -d After the container is started, we'll watch the logs with docker logs swag -f . We'll see some initialization and then we will see the validation steps. After all the steps, it should print Server ready in the logs. Now we can access the webserver by browsing to https://www.linuxserver-test.duckdns.org . NOTICE: Due to a DuckDNS limitation, our cert only covers the wildcard subdomains, but it doesn't cover the main url. So if we try to access https://linuxserver-test.duckdns.org , we'll see a browser warning about an invalid ssl cert. But accessing it through the www (or ombi or any other) subdomain should work fine. Web hosting examples Simple html web page hosting Once we have a working container, we can drop our web documents in and modify the nginx config files to set up our webserver. All the necessary files are under /config which is mapped from the host location (set by above examples) /home/aptalca/appdata/swag . We can drop all of our web/html files into /config/www . The main site config nginx uses can be found at /config/nginx/site-confs/default . Don't delete this file, as it will be regenerated on container restart, but feel free to modify as needed. By default, it is listening on port 443, and the root folder is set to /config/www , so if you drop a page1.html into that location, it will be accessible at https://linuxserver-test.com/page1.html . To enable listening on port 80 and automatically redirecting to port 443 for enforcing ssl, uncomment the lines at the top of the default site config so it reads: # redirect all traffic to https server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name _; return 301 https://$host$request_uri; } After any changes to the config files, simply restart the container via docker restart swag to reload the nginx config. Hosting a Wordpress site Wordpress requires a mysql database. For that, we'll use the linuxserver MariaDB docker image . Here's a docker compose stack to get both containers set up. For this exercise, we'll utilize the cloudflare dns plugin for Let's Encrypt validation, but you can use any other method to set it up as described in this linked section : --- version: \"2.1\" services: mariadb: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb container_name: mariadb environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mariadbpassword - TZ=Europe/London - MYSQL_DATABASE=WP_database - MYSQL_USER=WP_dbuser - MYSQL_PASSWORD=WP_dbpassword volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/mariadb:/config restart: unless-stopped swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=dns - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 depends_on: - mariadb restart: unless-stopped And here are the docker cli versions (make sure you already created the lsio network as described above : Mariadb: docker create \\ --name=mariadb \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mariadbpassword \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=WP_database \\ -e MYSQL_USER=WP_dbuser \\ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=WP_dbpassword \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/mariadb:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb SWAG: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=dns \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Once the SWAG container is set up with ssl certs and the webserver is up, we'll download the latest Wordpress and untar it into our www folder: wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz tar xvf latest.tar.gz -C /home/aptalca/appdata/swag/www/ rm latest.tar.gz Now that we have all the wordpress files under the container's /config/www/wordpress folder, we'll change the root directive in our SWAG default site conf to point there. We'll find the line in /config/nginx/site-confs/default that reads root /config/www; and change it to root /config/www/wordpress; and restart SWAG. Now we should be able to access our wordpress config page at https://linuxserver-test.com/wp-admin/install.php . We'll go ahead and enter mariadb as the Database Host address (we are using the container name as the dns hostname since both containers are in the same user defined bridge network), and also enter the Database Name, user and password we used in the mariadb config above ( WP_database , WP_dbuser and WP_dbpassword ). Once we go through the rest of the install steps, our wordpress instance should be fully set up and available at https://linuxserver-test.com . If you would like to have http requests on port 80 enabled and auto redirected to https on port 443, uncomment the relevant lines at the top of the default site config to read: # redirect all traffic to https server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name _; return 301 https://$host$request_uri; } Reverse Proxy A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client as if they originated from the Web server itself (Shamelessly borrowed from another post on our blog ). In this case, a user or a client browser can connect to our SWAG container via https on port 443, request a service such as Ombi, then our SWAG container connects to the ombi container, retrieves the data and passes it on to the client via https with our trusted cert. The connection to ombi is local and does not need to be encrypted, but all communication between our SWAG container and the client browser will be encrypted. Preset proxy confs Our SWAG image comes with a list of preset reverse proxy confs for popular apps and services. They are hosted on Github and are pulled into the /config/nginx/proxy-confs folder as inactive sample files. To activate, one must rename a conf file to remove .sample from the filename and restart the SWAG container. Any proxy conf file in that folder with a name that matches *.subdomain.conf or *.subfolder.conf will be loaded in nginx during container start. Most proxy confs work without any modification, but some may require other changes. All the required changes are listed at the top of each proxy conf. The conf files use container names to reach other containers and therefore the proxied containers should be named the same as listed in our documentation for each container. The conf files also require that the SWAG container is in the same user defined bridge network as the other container so they can reach each other via container name as dns hostnames. Make sure you follow the instructions listed above in the Docker networking section . Understanding the proxy conf structure Subdomain proxy conf Here's the preset proxy conf for Heimdall as a subdomain (ie. https://heimdall.linuxserver-test.com ): # make sure that your dns has a cname set for heimdall server { listen 443 ssl; listen [::]:443 ssl; server_name heimdall.*; include /config/nginx/ssl.conf; client_max_body_size 0; # enable for ldap auth, fill in ldap details in ldap.conf #include /config/nginx/ldap.conf; # enable for Authelia #include /config/nginx/authelia-server.conf; location / { # enable the next two lines for http auth #auth_basic \"Restricted\"; #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd; # enable the next two lines for ldap auth #auth_request /auth; #error_page 401 =200 /ldaplogin; # enable for Authelia #include /config/nginx/authelia-location.conf; include /config/nginx/proxy.conf; resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; set $upstream_app heimdall; set $upstream_port 443; set $upstream_proto https; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port; } } Let's dissect this conf to look at what each directive or block does. server { } This is our server block. Whenever nginx gets a request from a client, it determines which server block should be processed based on the destination server name, port and other relevant info, and the matching server block determines how nginx handles and responds to the request. listen 443 ssl; listen [::]:443 ssl; This means that only requests coming to port 443 will match this server block. server_name heimdall.*; Only destination addresses that match heimdall.* will match this server block. include /config/nginx/ssl.conf; This directive injects the contents of our ssl.conf file here, which contains all ssl related settings (cert location, ciphers used, etc.). client_max_body_size 0; Removes the size limitation on uploads (default 1MB). # enable for ldap auth, fill in ldap details in ldap.conf #include /config/nginx/ldap.conf; Commented out (disabled) by default. When enabled, it will inject the contents of ldap.conf, necessary settings for LDAP auth. # enable for Authelia #include /config/nginx/authelia-server.conf; Commented out (disabled) by default. When enabled, it will inject the contents of authelia-server.conf, necessary settings for Authelia integration. location / { } Location blocks are used for subfolders or paths. After a server block is matched, nginx will look at the subfolder or path requested to match one of the location blocks inside the selected server block. This particular block in our example is for / so it will match any subfolder or path at this address. # enable the next two lines for http auth #auth_basic \"Restricted\"; #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd; Commented out (disabled) by default. When enabled, it will use .htpasswd to perform user/pass authentication before allowing access. # enable the next two lines for ldap auth #auth_request /auth; #error_page 401 =200 /login; Commented out (disabled) by default. When enabled, it will use LDAP authentication before allowing access. # enable for Authelia #include /config/nginx/authelia-location.conf; Commented out (disabled) by default. When enabled, it will use Authelia authentication before allowing access. include /config/nginx/proxy.conf; Injects the contents of proxy.conf, which contains various directives and headers that are common for proxied connections. resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; Tells nginx to use the docker dns to resolve the IP address when the container name is used as address in the next line. set $upstream_app heimdall; set $upstream_port 443; set $upstream_proto https; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port; This is a bit of a tricky part. Normally, we could just put in the directive proxy_pass https://heimdall:443; and expect nginx to connect to Heimdall via its container name used as a dns hostname. Although it works for the most part, nginx has an annoying habit. During start, nginx checks all dns hostnames used in proxy_pass statements and if any one of them is not accessible, it refuses to start. We really don't want a stopped proxied container to prevent our webserver from starting up, so we use a trick. If the proxy_pass statement contains a variable instead of a dns hostname , nginx doesn't check whether it's accessible or not during start. So here we are setting 3 variables, one named upstream_app with the value of heimdall , one named $upstream_port , with the value of the internal heimdall port 443 , and one named $upstream_proto with the value set to https . We we use these variables as the address in the proxy_pass directive. That way, if the heimdall container is down for any reason, nginx can still start. When using a variable instead of hostname, we also have to set the resolver to docker dns in the previous line. If the proxied container is not in the same user defined bridge network as SWAG (could be on a remote host, could be using host networking or macvlan), we can change the value of $upstream_app to an IP address instead: set $upstream_app 192.168.1.10; Subfolder proxy conf Here's the preset proxy conf for mytinytodo via a subfolder # works with https://github.com/breakall/mytinytodo-docker # set the mtt_url to 'https://your.domain.com/todo/' in db/config.php location /todo { return 301 $scheme://$host/todo/; } location ^~ /todo/ { # enable the next two lines for http auth #auth_basic \"Restricted\"; #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd; # enable the next two lines for ldap auth, also customize and enable ldap.conf in the default conf #auth_request /auth; #error_page 401 =200 /ldaplogin; # enable for Authelia, also enable authelia-server.conf in the default site config #include /config/nginx/authelia-location.conf; include /config/nginx/proxy.conf; resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; set $upstream_app mytinytodo; set $upstream_port 80; set $upstream_proto http; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port/; } Unlike the subdomain proxy confs, here we do not have a server block. That is because all of the subfolder proxy confs get injected into the main server block of our root domain defined in the default site conf. So here we are only defining the location block for our specific subfolders. Many of the elements are the same as the subdomain ones, so for those you can refer to the previous section. Let's take a look at some of the differences. # works with https://github.com/breakall/mytinytodo-docker # set the mtt_url to 'https://your.domain.com/todo/' in db/config.php These are the instructions to get the tinytodo container ready to work with our reverse proxy. location ^~ /todo { return 301 $scheme://$host/todo/; } Redirects requests for https://linuxserver-test.com/todo to https://linuxserver-test.com/todo/ (added forward slash at the end). location ^~ /todo/ { } Any requests sent to nginx where the destination starts with https://linuxserver-test.com/todo/ will match this location block. set $upstream_app mytinytodo; set $upstream_port 80; set $upstream_proto http; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port/; Same as the previous example, we set a variable $upstream_app with the value mytinytodo and tell nginx to use the variable as the address. Keep in mind that the port listed here is the container port because nginx is connecting to this container directly via the docker network. So if our mytinytodo container has a port mapping of -p 8080:80 , we still set $upstream_port variable to 80 . Nginx has an interesting behavior displayed here. Even though we define http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/ as the address nginx should proxy, nginx actually connects to http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/todo . Whenever we use a variable as part of the proxy_pass url, nginx automatically appends the defined location (in this case /todo ) to the end of the proxy_pass url before it connects. If we include the subfolder, nginx will try to connect to http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/todo/todo and will fail. Ombi subdomain reverse proxy example In this example, we will reverse proxy Ombi at the address https://ombi.linuxserver-test.com . First let's make sure that we have a CNAME for ombi set up on our dns provider (a wildcard CNAME * will also cover this) and it is pointing to our A record that points to our server IP. If we are using the docker cli method, we also need to create the user defined bridge network (here named lsio ) as described above . We also need to make sure that port 443 on our router is forwarded to the correct port on our server. Here's a docker compose stack we can use to set up both containers: --- version: \"2.1\" services: ombi: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/ombi container_name: ombi environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/ombi:/config ports: - 3579:3579 restart: unless-stopped swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=dns - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped And here are the docker cli versions: Ombi: docker create \\ --name=ombi \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -p 3579:3579 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/ombi:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/ombi SWAG: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=dns \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Once our containers up and running (and we confirm we can reach the placeholder page at https://linuxserver-test.com ), we simply rename the file ombi.subdomain.conf.sample under /config/nginx/proxy-confs/ to ombi.subdomain.conf and we restart the SWAG container. Now when we browser to https://ombi.linuxserver-test.com we should see the Ombi gui. Nextcloud subdomain reverse proxy example Nextcloud is a bit trickier because the app has various security measures built-in, forcing us to configure certain options manually. As with the other examples, let's make sure that we have a CNAME for nextcloud set up on our dns provider (a wildcard CNAME * will also cover this) and it is pointing to our A record that points to our server IP. If we are using the docker cli method, we also need to create the user defined bridge network (here named lsio ) as described above . For DuckDNS, we do not need to create CNAMES, as all sub-subdomains automatically point to the same IP as our custom subdomain, but we need to make sure that it is the correct IP address for our server. We also need to make sure that port 443 on our router is forwarded to the correct port on our server. In this example we'll use the duckdns wildcard cert, but you can use any Let's Encrypt validation you like as described above Here's a docker compose stack to set up our SWAG, nextcloud and mariadb containers: --- version: \"2.1\" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud container_name: nextcloud environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/nextcloud/config:/config - /home/aptalca/appdata/nextcloud/data:/data depends_on: - mariadb restart: unless-stopped mariadb: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb container_name: mariadb environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mariadbpassword - TZ=Europe/London - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud - MYSQL_USER=ncuser - MYSQL_PASSWORD=ncpassword volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/mariadb:/config restart: unless-stopped swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.duckdns.org - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=duckdns - DUCKDNSTOKEN=97654867496t0877648659765854 volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped And here are the docker cli versions: Nextcloud: docker create \\ --name=nextcloud \\ --net=lsio -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/nextcloud/config:/config \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/nextcloud/data:/data \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud Mariadb: docker create \\ --name=mariadb \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mariadbpassword \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud \\ -e MYSQL_USER=ncuser \\ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=ncpassword \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/mariadb:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb SWAG: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.duckdns.org \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=duckdns \\ -e DUCKDNSTOKEN=97654867496t0877648659765854 \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Now we find the file named nextcloud.subdomain.conf.sample under SWAG's /config/nginx/proxy-confs folder and rename it to nextcloud.subdomain.conf , then restart the SWAG container. If this is the first time we are accessing Nextcloud (we've never accessed it locally before), we can simply navigate to https://nextcloud.linuxserver-test.duckdns.org and we should see the Nextcloud set up page. We'll fill out the info, use the mariadb user ncuser and the password we selected in the environment variable ( ncpassword in the above example) and we'll use mariadb as the Database Host address (container name as dns hostname). We should then be able to go through the intro slides and then see the Nextcloud dashboard with our shiny padlock icon next to the address bar. If this is an existing Nextcloud instance, or we set it up locally via the host IP address and local port, Nextcloud will reject proxied connections. In that case, we have to follow the instructions at the top of the nextcloud.subdomain.conf file: # assuming this container is called \"swag\", edit your nextcloud container's config # located at /config/www/nextcloud/config/config.php and add the following lines before the \");\": # 'trusted_proxies' => ['swag'], # 'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://nextcloud.your-domain.com/', # 'overwritehost' => 'nextcloud.your-domain.com', # 'overwriteprotocol' => 'https', # # Also don't forget to add your domain name to the trusted domains array. It should look somewhat like this: # array ( # 0 => '192.168.0.1:444', # This line may look different on your setup, don't modify it. # 1 => 'nextcloud.your-domain.com', # ), These settings will tell Nextcloud to respond to queries where the destination address is our domain name. If you followed the above directions to set it up for the first time, you only need to add the line 'trusted_proxies' => ['swag'], , otherwise nextcloud 16+ shows a warning about incorrect reverse proxy settings. By default, HSTS is disabled in SWAG config, because it is a bit of a sledgehammer that prevents loading of any http assets on the entire domain. You can enable it in SWAG's ssl.conf . Plex subfolder reverse proxy example In this example, we will set up Plex as a subfolder so it will be accessible at https://linuxserver-test.com/plex . We will initially set up Plex with host networking through its local IP and will connect to it from the same subnet. If we are on a different subnet, or if using a bridge network, we can use the PLEX_CLAIM variable to automatically claim the server with our plex account. Once the Plex server is set up, it is safe to switch it to bridge networking from host. Here's a docker compose stack we can use to set up both containers: --- version: \"2.1\" services: plex: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex container_name: plex network_mode: host environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - VERSION=docker volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/plex:/config - /home/aptalca/tvshows:/data/tvshows - /home/aptalca/movies:/data/movies restart: unless-stopped swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=dns - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped Here are the docker cli versions: Plex: docker create \\ --name=plex \\ --net=host \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e VERSION=docker \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/plex:/config \\ -v /home/aptalca/tvshows:/data/tvshows \\ -v /home/aptalca/movies:/data/movies \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/plex SWAG: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=dns \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Once the containers are set up, we browse to http://LOCALSERVERIP:32400/web and set up our Plex server with our Plex account. Then we can find the file named plex.subfolder.conf.sample under our SWAG container's /config/nginx/proxy-confs folder and rename it to plex.subfolder.conf . If we are using bridge networking for our plex container, we can restart the SWAG container and we should be able to access Plex at https://linuxserver-test.com/plex . If we are using host networking for our plex container, we will also have to make one modification to the plex.subfolder.conf . We need to find the line that reads proxy_pass http://$upstream_plex:32400; and replace $upstream_plex with our Plex server's local IP address (ie. proxy_pass http://192.168.1.10:32400; ). Then we can restart SWAG and access Plex at https://linuxserver-test.com/plex . If we want Plex to always use our domain to connect (including in mobile apps), we can add our url https://linuxserver-test.com/plex into the Custom server access URLs in Plex server settings. After that, it is OK to turn off remote access in Plex server settings and remove the port forwarding port 32400. After that, all connections to our Plex server will go through SWAG reverse proxy over port 443. Using Heimdall as the home page at domain root In this example, we will set Heimdall as our homepage at domain root so when we navigate to https://linuxserver-test.com we will reach Heimdall. As before, we need to make sure port 443 is properly forwarded to our server. We also need to make sure that if we are using the docker cli method, we need to create a user defined bridge network as defined above . Here's a docker compose stack we can use to set up both containers: --- version: \"2.1\" services: heimdall: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall container_name: heimdall environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/heimdall:/config restart: unless-stopped swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=dns - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped Here are the docker cli versions: Heimdall: docker create \\ --name=heimdall \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/heimdall:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall SWAG: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=dns \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Once the containers are set up, we'll find the file named heimdall.subfolder.conf.sample under SWAG's /config/nginx/proxy-confs folder and rename it to heimdall.subfolder.conf . If we look inside that conf file, we'll see that it is set to use location / { , which will cause an issue because there is already a location defined for / inside the default site config for SWAG. So we need to edit the default site config at /config/nginx/site-confs/default and comment out the location block for / inside our main server block so it reads: #location / { # try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html /index.php?$args =404; #} That way, nginx will use the / location block from our heimdall proxy conf instead. After that, when we navigate to https://linuxserver-test.com , we'll see the Heimdall interface. If we want to password protect our new homepage, we can run the following on the host command line to create a new .htpasswd file: docker exec -it swag htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd anyusername . After which, we can activate authentication by editing the heimdall.subfolder.conf file to uncomment the relevant lines so it reads: # enable the next two lines for http auth auth_basic \"Restricted\"; auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd; Troubleshooting We wrote a blogpost for the deprecated letsencrypt image diving into troubleshooting issues regarding dns and port-forwards, which still is a very good resource: blog.linuxserver.io Common errors 404 This error simply means that the resource was not found. Commonly happening when you try to access a subfolder that is not enabled. 502 This error means that nginx can't talk to the application. There is a few common reasons for this: The application and SWAG is not on the same custom docker network Further up we talk about how to set up Docker networking , however there are some other common traps The container name does not match the application name. Covered in the section for Understanding the proxy conf structure You manually changed the port. Also covered in the section for Understanding the proxy conf structure The container originally ran with host networking, or the default bridge. In most cases the contents of /config/nginx/resolver.conf; should be ...resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; , if this is not the case, you can: Delete it, and restart the container to have it regenerate Manually set the content(we wont override it) Final Thoughts This image can be used in many different scenarios as it is a full fledged web server with some bells and whistles added.

Your dns provider by default is the provider of your domain name and if they are not supported, it is very easy to switch to a different dns provider. Cloudflare is recommended due to being free and reliable. To switch to Cloudflare, you can register for a free account and follow their steps to point the nameservers to Cloudflare. The rest of the instructions assume that we are using the cloudflare dns plugin. On our dns provider, we'll create an A record for the main domain and point it to our server IP (wan).

Whenever nginx gets a request from a client, it determines which server block should be processed based on the destination server name, port and other relevant info, and the matching server block determines how nginx handles and responds to the request. listen 443 ssl; listen [::]:443 ssl; This means that only requests coming to port 443 will match this server block. server_name heimdall.*; Only destination addresses that match heimdall.* will match this server block. include /config/nginx/ssl.conf; This directive injects the contents of our ssl.conf file here, which contains all ssl related settings (cert location, ciphers used, etc.). client_max_body_size 0; Removes the size limitation on uploads (default 1MB). # enable for ldap auth, fill in ldap details in ldap.conf #include /config/nginx/ldap.conf; Commented out (disabled) by default.

When enabled, it will inject the contents of authelia-server.conf, necessary settings for Authelia integration. location / { } Location blocks are used for subfolders or paths. After a server block is matched, nginx will look at the subfolder or path requested to match one of the location blocks inside the selected server block. This particular block in our example is for / so it will match any subfolder or path at this address. # enable the next two lines for http auth #auth_basic \"Restricted\"; #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd; Commented out (disabled) by default.

Normally, we could just put in the directive proxy_pass https://heimdall:443; and expect nginx to connect to Heimdall via its container name used as a dns hostname. Although it works for the most part, nginx has an annoying habit. During start, nginx checks all dns hostnames used in proxy_pass statements and if any one of them is not accessible, it refuses to start. We really don't want a stopped proxied container to prevent our webserver from starting up, so we use a trick. If the proxy_pass statement contains a variable instead of a dns hostname , nginx doesn't check whether it's accessible or not during start. So here we are setting 3 variables, one named upstream_app with the value of heimdall , one named $upstream_port , with the value of the internal heimdall port 443 , and one named $upstream_proto with the value set to https . We we use these variables as the address in the proxy_pass directive. That way, if the heimdall container is down for any reason, nginx can still start. When using a variable instead of hostname, we also have to set the resolver to docker dns in the previous line. If the proxied container is not in the same user defined bridge network as SWAG (could be on a remote host, could be using host networking or macvlan), we can change the value of $upstream_app to an IP address instead: set $upstream_app 192.168.1.10;","title":"Subdomain proxy conf"},{"location":"general/swag/#subfolder-proxy-conf","text":"Here's the preset proxy conf for mytinytodo via a subfolder # works with https://github.com/breakall/mytinytodo-docker # set the mtt_url to 'https://your.domain.com/todo/' in db/config.php location /todo { return 301 $scheme://$host/todo/; } location ^~ /todo/ { # enable the next two lines for http auth #auth_basic \"Restricted\"; #auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd; # enable the next two lines for ldap auth, also customize and enable ldap.conf in the default conf #auth_request /auth; #error_page 401 =200 /ldaplogin; # enable for Authelia, also enable authelia-server.conf in the default site config #include /config/nginx/authelia-location.conf; include /config/nginx/proxy.conf; resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; set $upstream_app mytinytodo; set $upstream_port 80; set $upstream_proto http; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port/; } Unlike the subdomain proxy confs, here we do not have a server block. That is because all of the subfolder proxy confs get injected into the main server block of our root domain defined in the default site conf. So here we are only defining the location block for our specific subfolders. Many of the elements are the same as the subdomain ones, so for those you can refer to the previous section. Let's take a look at some of the differences. # works with https://github.com/breakall/mytinytodo-docker # set the mtt_url to 'https://your.domain.com/todo/' in db/config.php These are the instructions to get the tinytodo container ready to work with our reverse proxy. location ^~ /todo { return 301 $scheme://$host/todo/; } Redirects requests for https://linuxserver-test.com/todo to https://linuxserver-test.com/todo/ (added forward slash at the end). location ^~ /todo/ { } Any requests sent to nginx where the destination starts with https://linuxserver-test.com/todo/ will match this location block. set $upstream_app mytinytodo; set $upstream_port 80; set $upstream_proto http; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port/; Same as the previous example, we set a variable $upstream_app with the value mytinytodo and tell nginx to use the variable as the address. Keep in mind that the port listed here is the container port because nginx is connecting to this container directly via the docker network. So if our mytinytodo container has a port mapping of -p 8080:80 , we still set $upstream_port variable to 80 . Nginx has an interesting behavior displayed here. Even though we define http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/ as the address nginx should proxy, nginx actually connects to http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/todo . Whenever we use a variable as part of the proxy_pass url, nginx automatically appends the defined location (in this case /todo ) to the end of the proxy_pass url before it connects. If we include the subfolder, nginx will try to connect to http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/todo/todo and will fail.","title":"Subfolder proxy conf"},{"location":"general/swag/#ombi-subdomain-reverse-proxy-example","text":"In this example, we will reverse proxy Ombi at the address https://ombi.linuxserver-test.com .

Here's a docker compose stack we can use to set up both containers: --- version: \"2.1\" services: plex: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex container_name: plex network_mode: host environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - VERSION=docker volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/plex:/config - /home/aptalca/tvshows:/data/tvshows - /home/aptalca/movies:/data/movies restart: unless-stopped swag: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=linuxserver-test.com - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=dns - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare volumes: - /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped Here are the docker cli versions: Plex: docker create \\ --name=plex \\ --net=host \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e VERSION=docker \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/plex:/config \\ -v /home/aptalca/tvshows:/data/tvshows \\ -v /home/aptalca/movies:/data/movies \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/plex SWAG: docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --net=lsio \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=linuxserver-test.com \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=wildcard \\ -e VALIDATION=dns \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v /home/aptalca/appdata/swag:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/swag Once the containers are set up, we browse to http://LOCALSERVERIP:32400/web and set up our Plex server with our Plex account. Then we can find the file named plex.subfolder.conf.sample under our SWAG container's /config/nginx/proxy-confs folder and rename it to plex.subfolder.conf . If we are using bridge networking for our plex container, we can restart the SWAG container and we should be able to access Plex at https://linuxserver-test.com/plex . If we are using host networking for our plex container, we will also have to make one modification to the plex.subfolder.conf . We need to find the line that reads proxy_pass http://$upstream_plex:32400; and replace $upstream_plex with our Plex server's local IP address (ie. proxy_pass http://192.168.1.10:32400; ). Then we can restart SWAG and access Plex at https://linuxserver-test.com/plex . If we want Plex to always use our domain to connect (including in mobile apps), we can add our url https://linuxserver-test.com/plex into the Custom server access URLs in Plex server settings. After that, it is OK to turn off remote access in Plex server settings and remove the port forwarding port 32400. After that, all connections to our Plex server will go through SWAG reverse proxy over port 443.","title":"Plex subfolder reverse proxy example"},{"location":"general/swag/#using-heimdall-as-the-home-page-at-domain-root","text":"In this example, we will set Heimdall as our homepage at domain root so when we navigate to https://linuxserver-test.com we will reach Heimdall. As before, we need to make sure port 443 is properly forwarded to our server.

If we look inside that conf file, we'll see that it is set to use location / { , which will cause an issue because there is already a location defined for / inside the default site config for SWAG. So we need to edit the default site config at /config/nginx/site-confs/default and comment out the location block for / inside our main server block so it reads: #location / { # try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html /index.php?$args =404; #} That way, nginx will use the / location block from our heimdall proxy conf instead. After that, when we navigate to https://linuxserver-test.com , we'll see the Heimdall interface. If we want to password protect our new homepage, we can run the following on the host command line to create a new .htpasswd file: docker exec -it swag htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd anyusername .

While a container remains alive (in either an active or inactive state), the data inside its user-space remains intact. However, if you decide to recreate a container, all data within that container is lost. Volumes are an intrinsic aspect of container management, so it is useful to know how to create them. There are two ways to map persistent storage to your containers; container volumes, and directory overlays. All of our images reference persistent data by means of directory overlays. Mapping a volume to your container Firstly, you must understand which directories from within your container you wish to persist. All of our images come with side-by-side documentation on which internal directories are used by the application. As mentioned in the Running our Containers documentation, the most common directory you will wish to persist is the /config directory. Before you create your container, first create a directory on the host machine that will act as the home for your persisted data. We recommend creating the directory /opt/appdata . Under this tree, you can create a single configuration directory for each of your containers. When creating the container itself, now is the time to make use of the -v flag, which will tell Docker to overlay your host directory over the container's directory: docker create --name my_container \\ -v /opt/appdata/my_config:/config \\ linuxserver/<an_image> The above example shows how the usage of -v has mapped the host machine's /opt/appdata/my_config directory over the container's internal /config directory. Remember : When dealing with mapping overlays, it always reads host:container You can do this for as many directories as required by either you or the container itself.

This image does not support GPU rendering out of the box only accelerated workspace experience Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/blender:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Application Setup The application can be accessed at: * http://yourhost:3000/ By default the user/pass is abc/abc, if you change your password or want to login manually to the GUI session for any reason use the following link: http://yourhost:3000/?login=true You can also force login on the '/' path without this parameter by passing the environment variable -e AUTO_LOGIN=false . Hardware Acceleration This only applies to your desktop experience, this container is capable of supporting accelerated rendering with /dev/dri mounted in, but the AMD HIP and Nvidia CUDA runtimes are massive which are not installed by default in this container. Intel/ATI/AMD To leverage hardware acceleration you will need to mount /dev/dri video device inside of the conainer. --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device. Nvidia Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the container. Arm Devices Arm devices can run this image, but generally should not mount in /dev/dri. The OpenGL ES version is not high enough to run Blender. The program can run on these platforms though, leveraging CPU LLVMPipe rendering. Due to lack of arm32/64 binaries from the upstream project, our arm32/64 images install the latest version from the ubuntu repo, which is usually behind and thus the version the image is tagged with does not match the version contained. Keyboard Layouts This should match the layout on the computer you are accessing the container from. The keyboard layouts available for use are: * da-dk-qwerty- Danish keyboard * de-ch-qwertz- Swiss German keyboard (qwertz) * de-de-qwertz- German keyboard (qwertz) - OSK available * en-gb-qwerty- English (UK) keyboard * en-us-qwerty- English (US) keyboard - OSK available DEFAULT * es-es-qwerty- Spanish keyboard - OSK available * fr-ch-qwertz- Swiss French keyboard (qwertz) * fr-fr-azerty- French keyboard (azerty) - OSK available * it-it-qwerty- Italian keyboard - OSK available * ja-jp-qwerty- Japanese keyboard * pt-br-qwerty- Portuguese Brazilian keyboard * sv-se-qwerty- Swedish keyboard * tr-tr-qwerty- Turkish-Q keyboard Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: blender: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/blender:latest container_name: blender security_opt: - seccomp:unconfined #optional environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - SUBFOLDER=/ #optional - KEYBOARD=en-us-qwerty #optional volumes: - /path/to/config:/config ports: - 3000:3000 devices: - /dev/dri:/dev/dri #optional restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=blender \\ --security-opt seccomp=unconfined `#optional` \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e SUBFOLDER=/ `#optional` \\ -e KEYBOARD=en-us-qwerty `#optional` \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -v /path/to/config:/config \\ --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri `#optional` \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/blender:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u274c Application Setup This image sets up the calibre desktop app and makes its interface available via Guacamole server in the browser. The interface is available at http://your-ip:8080 . By default, there is no password set for the main gui. Optional environment variable PASSWORD will allow setting a password for the user abc . Port 8081 is reserved for Calibre's built-in webserver, which can be enabled within the desktop app settings, and the internal port must be set to 8081 although it will then be available at the host mapped port for external access. You can access advanced features of the Guacamole remote desktop using ctrl + alt + shift enabling you to use remote copy/paste and different languages.

The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Tag x86-64 amd64-latest arm64 arm64v8-latest armhf arm32v7-latest Application Setup Clarkson requires v5.7.* of MySQL and please ensure MySQL is running before starting this container . It is preferred if you create the clarkson schema before initially running the container, then creating a user with granted permissions for the schema. Creating the schema before running the app is important as the \"clarkson\" user will not have permission to create the schema on your behalf. You can, of course, use the \"root\" user, which has the ability to create schemas automatically, but this is not recommended. CREATE SCHEMA `clarkson`; CREATE USER 'clarkson_user' IDENTIFIED BY 'supersecretpassword'; GRANT ALL ON `clarkson`.* TO 'clarkson_user'; Once running, the container will run an initial MySQL migration, which populates the schema with all tables and procedures. The application will start immediately afterwards. You will need to register an initial user, of which will be the admin of the application. All subsequent users will be standard users. You can disable registrations after the fact by recreating the container with the ENABLE_REGISTRATIONS flag set to false . This will not hide the \"Register\" link, but will disable the functionality. Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: clarkson: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/clarkson container_name: clarkson environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_host> - MYSQL_USERNAME=<mysql_username> - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql_password> - ENABLE_REGISTRATIONS=<true/false> - TZ=Europe/London ports: - 3000:3000 restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=clarkson \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_host> \\ -e MYSQL_USERNAME=<mysql_username> \\ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql_password> \\ -e ENABLE_REGISTRATIONS=<true/false> \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/clarkson Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 3000 WebUI Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation MYSQL_HOST=<mysql_host> Points the backend to the MySQL database.

ENABLE_REGISTRATIONS=<true/false> Defaults to false . If set to true , allows new users to register. TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH= Optionally set sudo password via hash (takes priority over SUDO_PASSWORD var). Format is $type$salt$hashed . PROXY_DOMAIN=code-server.my.domain If this optional variable is set, this domain will be proxied for subdomain proxying. See Documentation DEFAULT_WORKSPACE=/config/workspace If this optional variable is set, code-server will open this directory by default Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Contains all relevant configuration files. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support.

COPS links to your Calibre library database and allows downloading and emailing of books directly from a web browser and provides a OPDS feed to connect to your devices. Changes in your Calibre library are reflected immediately in your COPS pages. See : COPS's home for more details. Don't forget to check the Wiki . Why? (taken from the author's site) In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much dependencies to be used for its content server. That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case). I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no search was possible. Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo. So COPS's main advantages are : * No need for many dependencies. * No need for a lot of CPU or RAM. * Not much code. * Search is available. * With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server. * It was fun to code. If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify feed.php at the end of your URL. Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/cops:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

For connecting via OPDS on a mobile device use http://<docker host ip>:80/feed.php . It is strongly suggested that you reverse proxy this prior to exposing to the internet. For more information, such as requiring credentials, check the COPS Wiki (linked above). The linuxserver version gives you access to config_local.php in /config to customise your install to suit your needs, it also includes the dependencies required to directly view epub books in your browser.

Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID .

Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync and AMD VAAPI will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container: --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device. Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the emby docker. OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi) Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi OpenMAX will need to mount their /dev/vchiq video device inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container: --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib V4L2 (Raspberry Pi) Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their /dev/video1X devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container: --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10 --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11 --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12 Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: emby: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/emby:latest container_name: emby environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /path/to/library:/config - /path/to/tvshows:/data/tvshows - /path/to/movies:/data/movies - /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib #optional ports: - 8096:8096 - 8920:8920 #optional devices: - /dev/dri:/dev/dri #optional - /dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq #optional - /dev/video10:/dev/video10 #optional - /dev/video11:/dev/video11 #optional - /dev/video12:/dev/video12 #optional restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=emby \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -p 8096:8096 \\ -p 8920:8920 `#optional` \\ -v /path/to/library:/config \\ -v /path/to/tvshows:/data/tvshows \\ -v /path/to/movies:/data/movies \\ -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib `#optional` \\ --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri `#optional` \\ --device /dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq `#optional` \\ --device /dev/video10:/dev/video10 `#optional` \\ --device /dev/video11:/dev/video11 `#optional` \\ --device /dev/video12:/dev/video12 `#optional` \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/emby:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

A mix of emulators is used between Libretro and EmulatorJS. Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Application Setup The Backend can be accessed at: http://yourhost:3000/ The first thing you will need to do is click to download the default art/configs from this interface, this will setup a skeleton directory in your /data mount. From there add roms to the respective roms directories and follow the on screen instructions to add them to your web frontend running on port 80. The frontend application has been initially optimized around being used with a standard gamepad (more specifically for modern Xbox consoles that have chromium based Edge browsers). The navigation revolves around the up/down/left/right keys to browse the menus and launch games. Mobile browsers will function, just keep in mind compatibility will be reduced especially for CD based games. It is important to note that some of the current emulators used for this frontend are obfuscated code, efforts are being made to reverse engineer it but you should know it can potentially reach out to third party services if you manually enable features like netplay (this should never happen in a stock setup). The point of this message is that on top of the de-obfuscation effort there is also effort to stop using binary blobs and shift to built from source libretro emscripten blobs, for now this web based emulation stack is the best for useability and compatibility. We are in the process to transitioning to libretro cores for emulators, currently 27/30 emulators have been replaced. For Xbox users please click the select button a couple times after launching a game to ensure the B button does not trigger a \"back\" action in the browser. (official name \"view button\" it is the two small squares) Exiting the controller mode and back to browser controls can be triggered by holding the start button for 3 seconds. (official name \"menu button\" the three lines) You will be unable to use features like save states and modify controller layouts on the emulatorjs based emulators currently as I have not determined a methodology of re-entering controller mode once you exit it. All normal game saves will function given you exit the game play screen cleanly using the B button for back this includes multi disc games for psx. Your game saves are stored in browser storage by hostname so if you make any changes to your local hosted setup (port or IP) the saves will not follow with it. For libretro based emulators you can use the button combination start+select+L+R to access the libretro menu and change settings/save or load/etc. We know about most of the oddities like crackling sound for some emulators, rendering issues, and games unreliably auto launching to fullscreen. In general full CD games on the Xbox web browser do not seem to work due to their size if you have a chd/pbp less than 450 megs it will run. Edge on Xbox has some kind of undocumented ram limitation of about a gigabyte. Until all emulators are transitioned to libretro cores the oddities of using self hosted EmulatorJS will not be something that can or should be solved using hacky workarounds interacting with obfuscated code. Just keep in mind these are full blown machine emulators running in Javascript in a browser, do not expect bare metal performance. Mounting in existing rom directories can be achieved by pointing to the default folder structure, IE lets say you would like to mount your NES library: -v /path/to/nes/roms:/data/nes/roms The folder names are: * 3do * arcade * atari2600 * atari7800 * colecovision * doom * gb * gba * gbc * jaguar * lynx * msx * n64 * nds * nes * ngp * odyssey2 * pce * psx * sega32x * segaCD * segaGG * segaMD * segaMS * segaSaturn * segaSG * snes * vb * vectrex * ws Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: emulatorjs: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs:latest container_name: emulatorjs environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - SUBFOLDER=/ #optional volumes: - /path/to/config:/config - /path/to/data:/data ports: - 3000:3000 - 80:80 - 4001:4001 #optional restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=emulatorjs \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e SUBFOLDER=/ `#optional` \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -p 80:80 \\ -p 4001:4001 `#optional` \\ -v /path/to/config:/config \\ -v /path/to/data:/data \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

From there add roms to the respective roms directories and follow the on screen instructions to add them to your web frontend running on port 80. The frontend application has been initially optimized around being used with a standard gamepad (more specifically for modern Xbox consoles that have chromium based Edge browsers). The navigation revolves around the up/down/left/right keys to browse the menus and launch games. Mobile browsers will function, just keep in mind compatibility will be reduced especially for CD based games. It is important to note that some of the current emulators used for this frontend are obfuscated code, efforts are being made to reverse engineer it but you should know it can potentially reach out to third party services if you manually enable features like netplay (this should never happen in a stock setup). The point of this message is that on top of the de-obfuscation effort there is also effort to stop using binary blobs and shift to built from source libretro emscripten blobs, for now this web based emulation stack is the best for useability and compatibility. We are in the process to transitioning to libretro cores for emulators, currently 27/30 emulators have been replaced. For Xbox users please click the select button a couple times after launching a game to ensure the B button does not trigger a \"back\" action in the browser. (official name \"view button\" it is the two small squares) Exiting the controller mode and back to browser controls can be triggered by holding the start button for 3 seconds. (official name \"menu button\" the three lines) You will be unable to use features like save states and modify controller layouts on the emulatorjs based emulators currently as I have not determined a methodology of re-entering controller mode once you exit it. All normal game saves will function given you exit the game play screen cleanly using the B button for back this includes multi disc games for psx. Your game saves are stored in browser storage by hostname so if you make any changes to your local hosted setup (port or IP) the saves will not follow with it. For libretro based emulators you can use the button combination start+select+L+R to access the libretro menu and change settings/save or load/etc. We know about most of the oddities like crackling sound for some emulators, rendering issues, and games unreliably auto launching to fullscreen. In general full CD games on the Xbox web browser do not seem to work due to their size if you have a chd/pbp less than 450 megs it will run. Edge on Xbox has some kind of undocumented ram limitation of about a gigabyte. Until all emulators are transitioned to libretro cores the oddities of using self hosted EmulatorJS will not be something that can or should be solved using hacky workarounds interacting with obfuscated code. Just keep in mind these are full blown machine emulators running in Javascript in a browser, do not expect bare metal performance.

We make pre-defined bots we use in our workflow, but you have to have an underlying understanding of javascript and some basic Docker skills to use it. The entire basis of this is to act as middleware between your email address receiving orders from https://checkout.linuxserver.io and send them to some external service. The bot will archive any messages that do not come from orders@nanocheckout.com with valid DKIM signatures, so definetly do not use this on a personal account. The concept behind this bot and using email as a destination for orders is to serve normal users that simply want an email for an order out of the box and provide a free messaging queue akin to something like RabbitMQ for people that want to automate order ingestion. By default we include bots we use that will be copied over on first container run, for example a simple discord ping when an order is received with the order details: const Discord = require('discord.js'); const YAML = require('yaml'); const discordtoken = process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN; const roomid = process.env.DISCORD_ROOM exports.orderbot = async function(order) { return new Promise(resolve => { const client = new Discord.Client(); client.login(discordtoken); client.on('ready', async () => { delete order.rawpayload await client.channels.cache.get(roomid.toString()).send(YAML.stringify(order)); client.destroy(); resolve(true) }) }); } This code will be passed an order object containing all the order details parsed from the email message. Here we use custom env variables to set application settings to connect up to and send a message to discord. In order to use this bot you will need to perform the following setup steps: 1. Create a dedicated gmail account to use for https://checkout.linuxserver.io 2. Enable API access to this Gmail account by clicking on Enable the Gmail API here https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/nodejs 3. Save your credentials.json file from that action to the folder you will be bind mounting as /config 4. Run docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v /path/to/data:/config --entrypoint /config.sh lsiodev/gmail-order-bot 5. Go to the URL prompted and enter the key you get from it. 6. Start the container using the run/compose example in this readme. When the container starts if you are using a custom bot located in /config/bots it will install the node modules included in it's package.json, do not use system level node modules this container is Alpine based and it will cause conflicts. From there the bot will loop in for your defined timeout and pull in emails and spit out orders to your destination.

The Bridge handles basic commands such as \"On\", \"Off\" and \"brightness\" commands of the hue protocol. This bridge can control most devices that have a distinct API. In the cases of systems that require authorization and/or have APIs that cannot be handled in the current method, a module may need to be built. The Harmony Hub is such a module and so is the Nest module. The Bridge has helpers to build devices for the gateway for the Logitech Harmony Hub, Vera, Vera Lite or Vera Edge, Nest, Somfy Tahoma, Home Assistant, Domoticz, MQTT, HAL, Fibaro, HomeWizard, LIFX, OpenHAB, FHEM, Broadlink and the ability to proxy all of your real Hue bridges behind this bridge.

In the cases of systems that require authorization and/or have APIs that cannot be handled in the current method, a module may need to be built.

Now it is great and well maintained, hosting it on a static webserver does not make much sense anymore. linuxserver/ipfs Ipfs - A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Supported Architectures Our images support multiple architectures such as x86-64 , arm64 and armhf . We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/ipfs should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Tag x86-64 amd64-latest arm64 arm64v8-latest armhf arm32v7-latest Application Setup In order to push files beyond your local gateway you have to make sure port 4001 is forwarded to the internet. This is required for IPFS peers to reach in and grab your files so public gateways can serve them. Access the webui at http://localhost , if not using localhost scroll to the bottom of the page and set the API Address setting to IE http://192.168.1.10:5001 , from there you can upload and manage files you push to IPFS. Your gateway to access IPFS files is http://localhost:8080/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE . You can also simply use public IPFS gateways like: * Cloudflare - https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE * IPFS.io - https://ipfs.io/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE * Eternum.io - https://ipfs.eternum.io/ipfs/YOUR-FILE-HASH-HERE Cloudflare is a solid option as they actually edge cache the files on their CDN so even if your node pinning the item goes down for periods of time their cache will last up to a month.

Nvidia Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the jellyfin docker container. OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi) Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi MMAL/OpenMAX will need to mount their /dev/vcsm and /dev/vchiq video devices inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container: --device=/dev/vcsm:/dev/vcsm --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib V4L2 (Raspberry Pi) Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their /dev/video1X devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container: --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10 --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11 --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12 Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: jellyfin: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest container_name: jellyfin environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=192.168.0.5 #optional volumes: - /path/to/library:/config - /path/to/tvseries:/data/tvshows - /path/to/movies:/data/movies ports: - 8096:8096 - 8920:8920 #optional - 7359:7359/udp #optional - 1900:1900/udp #optional restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=jellyfin \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=192.168.0.5 `#optional` \\ -p 8096:8096 \\ -p 8920:8920 `#optional` \\ -p 7359:7359/udp `#optional` \\ -p 1900:1900/udp `#optional` \\ -v /path/to/library:/config \\ -v /path/to/tvseries:/data/tvshows \\ -v /path/to/movies:/data/movies \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 8096 Http webUI. 8920 Optional - Https webUI (you need to set up your own certificate). 7359/udp Optional - Allows clients to discover Jellyfin on the local network. 1900/udp Optional - Service discovery used by DNLA and clients. Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use (e.g. Europe/London). JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=192.168.0.5 Set the autodiscovery response domain or IP address. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Jellyfin data storage location. This can grow very large, 50gb+ is likely for a large collection. /data/tvshows Media goes here. Add as many as needed e.g. /data/movies , /data/tv , etc. /data/movies Media goes here. Add as many as needed e.g. /data/movies , /data/tv , etc. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. Optional Parameters The official documentation for ports has additional ports that can provide auto discovery. Service Discovery ( 1900/udp ) - Since client auto-discover would break if this option were configurable, you cannot change this in the settings at this time. DLNA also uses this port and is required to be in the local subnet. Client Discovery ( 7359/udp ) - Allows clients to discover Jellyfin on the local network. A broadcast message to this port with \"Who is Jellyfin Server?\" will get a JSON response that includes the server address, ID, and name. -p 7359:7359/udp \\ -p 1900:1900/udp \\ The official documentation for environmentals has additional environmentals that can provide additional configurability such as migrating to the native Jellyfin image. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

Create an Amazon Developer Account here. Open a terminal in the /config directory of the docker container docker exec -itw /config kanzi bash Enter lexigram login --no-browser true to setup your AWS credentials and copy the URL into a browser, login to your Amazon Developer Account and copy/paste the resulting authorisation code back into the terminal and press enter. Edit the file kodi.config according to your local setup and this will be used by the included gunicorn server to respond to requests. Restart the container to automatically deploy the Kanzi skill. Reverse proxy this container with our LetsEncrypt container which contains preconfigured templates for reverse proxying the Kanzi container on either a subdomain or subfolder utilising Docker custom networking. Alternatively, if you already have an Nginx reverse proxy set up, you can use one of these location blocks to reverse proxy Kanzi to a subfolder or subdomain respectively.

Once setup is complete access https:// your ip :443 and login with the credentials you entered during setup. The default users are: admin@kasm.local user@kasm.local Currently Synology systems are not supported due to them blocking CPU scheduling in their Kernel. GPU Support During installation an option will be presented to force all Workspace containers to mount in and use a specific GPU. If using an NVIDIA GPU you will need to pass -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all or --gpus all and have the NVIDIA Container Runtime installed on the host. Also if using NVIDIA, Kasm Workspaces has native NVIDIA support so you can optionally opt to simply use that instead of he manual override during installation. Gamepad support In order to properly create virtual Gamepads you will need to mount from your host /dev/input and /run/udev/data . Please see HERE for instructions on enabling gamepad support. Persistant profiles In order to use persistant profiles in Workspaces you will need to mount in a folder to use from your host to /profiles .

Hardware Acceleration (x86_64 only) In order to perform hardware transcoding you will need to mount a video device into the container. Some of the default hardware rendering/transcode profiles will point to devices in /dev/dri for vaapi_device . Make sure the profile you are using points to the correct device in the container. IE if you have intel integrated graphics along with an Nvdia or AMD video card you might have renderD128, renderD129, etc. To check which device is which use vainfo from inside the container: (right click the desktop and open xterm) vainfo --display drm --device /dev/dri/renderD128 Intel/ATI/AMD To leverage hardware acceleration you will need to mount /dev/dri video device inside of the conainer. --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device. Nvidia Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the container. Keyboard Layouts This should match the layout on the computer you are accessing the container from.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED AND THE PROJECT IS MOVED TO A NEW REPO Due to a trademark related request, this image is moved to a new repo on Docker Hub and GitHub . This is a breaking change and you need to manually update. Apologies for the the disruption. Switching existing implementations over to the new image is very easy, just follow these simple steps: https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag#migrating-from-the-old-linuxserverletsencrypt-image This repository will be archived and builds for the image will no longer be created at the end of 2020 linuxserver/letsencrypt SWAG - Secure Web-server And Gateway (formerly known as letsencrypt, no relation to Let's Encrypt\u2122) sets up an Nginx webserver and reverse proxy with php support and a built-in certbot client that automates free SSL server certificate generation and renewal processes. It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention. Supported Architectures Our images support multiple architectures such as x86-64 , arm64 and armhf . We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling linuxserver/letsencrypt should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Tag x86-64 amd64-latest arm64 arm64v8-latest armhf arm32v7-latest Usage Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container. docker docker create \\ --name=swag \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e URL=yourdomain.url \\ -e SUBDOMAINS=www, \\ -e VALIDATION=http \\ -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare `#optional` \\ -e PROPAGATION= `#optional` \\ -e DUCKDNSTOKEN= `#optional` \\ -e EMAIL= `#optional` \\ -e ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false `#optional` \\ -e EXTRA_DOMAINS= `#optional` \\ -e STAGING=false `#optional` \\ -p 443:443 \\ -p 80:80 `#optional` \\ -v /path/to/appdata/config:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/letsencrypt docker-compose Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas. --- version: \"2.1\" services: swag: image: linuxserver/letsencrypt container_name: swag cap_add: - NET_ADMIN environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - URL=yourdomain.url - SUBDOMAINS=www, - VALIDATION=http - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare #optional - PROPAGATION= #optional - DUCKDNSTOKEN= #optional - EMAIL= #optional - ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false #optional - EXTRA_DOMAINS= #optional - STAGING=false #optional volumes: - /path/to/appdata/config:/config ports: - 443:443 - 80:80 #optional restart: unless-stopped Parameters Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Parameter Function -p 443 Https port -p 80 Http port (required for http validation and http -> https redirect) -e PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation -e PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation -e TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. -e URL=yourdomain.url Top url you have control over ( customdomain.com if you own it, or customsubdomain.ddnsprovider.com if dynamic dns). -e SUBDOMAINS=www, Subdomains you'd like the cert to cover (comma separated, no spaces) ie. www,ftp,cloud . For a wildcard cert, set this exactly to wildcard (wildcard cert is available via dns and duckdns validation only) -e VALIDATION=http Certbot validation method to use, options are http , dns or duckdns ( dns method also requires DNSPLUGIN variable set) ( duckdns method requires DUCKDNSTOKEN variable set, and the SUBDOMAINS variable must be either empty or set to wildcard ). -e DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare Required if VALIDATION is set to dns . Options are aliyun , cloudflare , cloudxns , cpanel , digitalocean , dnsimple , dnsmadeeasy , domeneshop , gandi , google , inwx , linode , luadns , nsone , ovh , rfc2136 , route53 and transip . Also need to enter the credentials into the corresponding ini (or json for some plugins) file under /config/dns-conf . -e PROPAGATION= Optionally override (in seconds) the default propagation time for the dns plugins. -e DUCKDNSTOKEN= Required if VALIDATION is set to duckdns . Retrieve your token from https://www.duckdns.org -e EMAIL= Optional e-mail address used for cert expiration notifications. -e ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false If you wish to get certs only for certain subdomains, but not the main domain (main domain may be hosted on another machine and cannot be validated), set this to true -e EXTRA_DOMAINS= Additional fully qualified domain names (comma separated, no spaces) ie. extradomain.com,subdomain.anotherdomain.org,*.anotherdomain.org -e STAGING=false Set to true to retrieve certs in staging mode. Rate limits will be much higher, but the resulting cert will not pass the browser's security test. Only to be used for testing purposes. -v /config All the config files including the webroot reside here. Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Application Setup Validation and initial setup Before running this container, make sure that the url and subdomains are properly forwarded to this container's host, and that port 443 (and/or 80) is not being used by another service on the host (NAS gui, another webserver, etc.). For http validation, port 80 on the internet side of the router should be forwarded to this container's port 80 For dns validation, make sure to enter your credentials into the corresponding ini (or json for some plugins) file under /config/dns-conf Cloudflare provides free accounts for managing dns and is very easy to use with this image. Make sure that it is set up for \"dns only\" instead of \"dns + proxy\" Google dns plugin is meant to be used with \"Google Cloud DNS\", a paid enterprise product, and not for \"Google Domains DNS\" For duckdns validation, either leave the SUBDOMAINS variable empty or set it to wildcard , and set the DUCKDNSTOKEN variable with your duckdns token. Due to a limitation of duckdns, the resulting cert will only cover either main subdomain (ie. yoursubdomain.duckdns.org ), or sub-subdomains (ie. *.yoursubdomain.duckdns.org ), but will not both at the same time. You can use our duckdns image to update your IP on duckdns.org. --cap-add=NET_ADMIN is required for fail2ban to modify iptables If you need a dynamic dns provider, you can use the free provider duckdns.org where the URL will be yoursubdomain.duckdns.org and the SUBDOMAINS can be www,ftp,cloud with http validation, or wildcard with dns validation. After setup, navigate to https://yourdomain.url to access the default homepage (http access through port 80 is disabled by default, you can enable it by editing the default site config at /config/nginx/site-confs/default ). Certs are checked nightly and if expiration is within 30 days, renewal is attempted. If your cert is about to expire in less than 30 days, check the logs under /config/log/letsencrypt to see why the renewals have been failing. It is recommended to input your e-mail in docker parameters so you receive expiration notices from Let's Encrypt in those circumstances. Security and password protection The container detects changes to url and subdomains, revokes existing certs and generates new ones during start. The container provides a pre-generated 4096-bit dhparams.pem (rotated weekly via Jenkins job ) for new instances, however you may generate your own by running docker exec letsencrypt openssl dhparam -out /config/nginx/dhparams.pem 4096 WARNING: This takes a very long time If you'd like to password protect your sites, you can use htpasswd. Run the following command on your host to generate the htpasswd file docker exec -it letsencrypt htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd <username> You can add multiple user:pass to .htpasswd . For the first user, use the above command, for others, use the above command without the -c flag, as it will force deletion of the existing .htpasswd and creation of a new one You can also use ldap auth for security and access control. A sample, user configurable ldap.conf is provided, and it requires the separate image linuxserver/ldap-auth to communicate with an ldap server. Site config and reverse proxy The default site config resides at /config/nginx/site-confs/default . Feel free to modify this file, and you can add other conf files to this directory. However, if you delete the default file, a new default will be created on container start. Preset reverse proxy config files are added for popular apps. See the README.md file under /config/nginx/proxy_confs for instructions on how to enable them. The preset confs reside in and get imported from this repo . If you wish to hide your site from search engine crawlers, you may find it useful to add this configuration line to your site config, within the server block, above the line where ssl.conf is included add_header X-Robots-Tag \"noindex, nofollow, nosnippet, noarchive\"; This will ask Google et al not to index and list your site. Be careful with this, as you will eventually be de-listed if you leave this line in on a site you wish to be present on search engines If you wish to redirect http to https, you must expose port 80 Using certs in other containers This container includes auto-generated pfx and private-fullchain-bundle pem certs that are needed by other apps like Emby and Znc. To use these certs in other containers, do either of the following: (Easier) Mount the container's config folder in other containers (ie. -v /path-to-le-config:/le-ssl ) and in the other containers, use the cert location /le-ssl/keys/letsencrypt/ (More secure) Mount the letsencrypt folder etc/letsencrypt that resides under /config in other containers (ie. -v /path-to-le-config/etc/letsencrypt:/le-ssl ) and in the other containers, use the cert location /le-ssl/live/<your.domain.url>/ (This is more secure because the first method shares the entire letsencrypt config folder with other containers, including the www files, whereas the second method only shares the ssl certs) These certs include: cert.pem , chain.pem , fullchain.pem and privkey.pem , which are generated by Let's Encrypt and used by nginx and various other apps privkey.pfx , a format supported by Microsoft and commonly used by dotnet apps such as Emby Server (no password) priv-fullchain-bundle.pem , a pem cert that bundles the private key and the fullchain, used by apps like ZNC Using fail2ban This container includes fail2ban set up with 3 jails by default: nginx-http-auth nginx-badbots nginx-botsearch To enable or disable other jails, modify the file /config/fail2ban/jail.local To modify filters and actions, instead of editing the .conf files, create .local files with the same name and edit those because .conf files get overwritten when the actions and filters are updated. .local files will append whatever's in the .conf files (ie. nginx-http-auth.conf --> nginx-http-auth.local ) You can check which jails are active via docker exec -it swag fail2ban-client status You can check the status of a specific jail via docker exec -it swag fail2ban-client status <jail name> You can unban an IP via docker exec -it swag fail2ban-client set <jail name> unbanip <IP> A list of commands can be found here: https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Commands Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) can be accessed via the dynamic badge above. Support Info Shell access whilst the container is running: docker exec -it swag /bin/bash To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: docker logs -f swag container version number docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels \"build_version\" }}' swag image version number docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels \"build_version\" }}' linuxserver/letsencrypt Updating Info Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the Application Setup section above to see if it is recommended for the image. Below are the instructions for updating containers: Via Docker Run/Create Update the image: docker pull linuxserver/letsencrypt Stop the running container: docker stop swag Delete the container: docker rm swag Recreate a new container with the same docker create parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your /config folder and settings will be preserved) Start the new container: docker start swag You can also remove the old dangling images: docker image prune Via Docker Compose Update all images: docker-compose pull or update a single image: docker-compose pull swag Let compose update all containers as necessary: docker-compose up -d or update a single container: docker-compose up -d swag You can also remove the old dangling images: docker image prune Via Watchtower auto-updater (especially useful if you don't remember the original parameters) Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one run: docker run --rm \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ containrrr/watchtower \\ --run-once swag Note: We do not endorse the use of Watchtower as a solution to automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact we generally discourage automated updates. However, this is a useful tool for one-time manual updates of containers where you have forgotten the original parameters. In the long term, we highly recommend using Docker Compose. You can also remove the old dangling images: docker image prune Building locally If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic: git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-letsencrypt.git cd docker-letsencrypt docker build \\ --no-cache \\ --pull \\ -t linuxserver/letsencrypt:latest . The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using multiarch/qemu-user-static docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with -f Dockerfile.aarch64 .

Find custom.cnf in /config for config changes (restart container for them to take effect) , the databases in /config/databases and the log in /config/log/myqsl Loading passwords and users from files The MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD MYSQL_DATABASE MYSQL_USER MYSQL_PASSWORD REMOTE_SQL env values can be set in a file: /config/env Using the following format: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=\"ROOT_ACCESS_PASSWORD\" MYSQL_DATABASE=\"USER_DB_NAME\" MYSQL_USER=\"MYSQL_USER\" MYSQL_PASSWORD=\"DATABASE_PASSWORD\" REMOTE_SQL=\"http://URL1/your.sql,https://URL2/your.sql\" These settings can be mixed and matched with Docker ENV settings as you require, but the settings in the file will always take precedence. Bootstrapping a new instance We support a one time run of custom sql files on init. In order to use this place *.sql files in: /config/initdb.d/ This will have the same effect as setting the REMOTE_SQL environment variable. The sql will only be run on the containers first boot and setup. Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: mariadb: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:latest container_name: mariadb environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ROOT_ACCESS_PASSWORD - TZ=Europe/London - MYSQL_DATABASE=USER_DB_NAME #optional - MYSQL_USER=MYSQL_USER #optional - MYSQL_PASSWORD=DATABASE_PASSWORD #optional - REMOTE_SQL=http://URL1/your.sql,https://URL2/your.sql #optional volumes: - path_to_data:/config ports: - 3306:3306 restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=mariadb \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ROOT_ACCESS_PASSWORD \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=USER_DB_NAME `#optional` \\ -e MYSQL_USER=MYSQL_USER `#optional` \\ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=DATABASE_PASSWORD `#optional` \\ -e REMOTE_SQL=http://URL1/your.sql,https://URL2/your.sql `#optional` \\ -p 3306:3306 \\ -v path_to_data:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 3306 Mariadb listens on this port. Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ROOT_ACCESS_PASSWORD Set this to root password for installation (minimum 4 characters & non-alphanumeric passwords must be properly escaped). TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. MYSQL_DATABASE=USER_DB_NAME Specify the name of a database to be created on image startup. MYSQL_USER=MYSQL_USER This user will have superuser access to the database specified by MYSQL_DATABASE (do not use root here). MYSQL_PASSWORD=DATABASE_PASSWORD Set this to the password you want to use for you MYSQL_USER (minimum 4 characters & non-alphanumeric passwords must be properly escaped). REMOTE_SQL=http://URL1/your.sql,https://URL2/your.sql Set this to ingest sql files from an http/https endpoint (comma seperated array). Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Contains the db itself and all assorted settings. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above.

Supported Architectures Our images support multiple architectures such as x86-64 , arm64 and armhf . We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/musicbrainz should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container.

Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file.

We do not officially support upgrading this container in place with existing data sets. If you did not set WEBADDRESS env variable, then AFTER iniatilisation is complete you will need to edit the line sub WEB_SERVER { \"localhost:5000\" } in file /config/DBDefs.pm changing localhost to the ip of your host, this is to allow css to display properly You must register here to receive a MusicBrainz code to allow you to receive database updates, it is free. Get Code here . The initial import and setup of the database can take quite a long time, dependant on your download speed etc, be patient and don't restart the container before it's complete. It appears there are issues with unraid and using /mnt/user/cache/appdata instead of /mnt/cache/appdata, use /mnt/cache/appdata. Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above. Support Info Shell access whilst the container is running: docker exec -it musicbrainz /bin/bash To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: docker logs -f musicbrainz container version number docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels \"build_version\" }}' musicbrainz image version number docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels \"build_version\" }}' lscr.io/linuxserver/musicbrainz Updating Info Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the Application Setup section above to see if it is recommended for the image. Below are the instructions for updating containers: Via Docker Compose Update all images: docker-compose pull or update a single image: docker-compose pull musicbrainz Let compose update all containers as necessary: docker-compose up -d or update a single container: docker-compose up -d musicbrainz You can also remove the old dangling images: docker image prune Via Docker Run Update the image: docker pull lscr.io/linuxserver/musicbrainz Stop the running container: docker stop musicbrainz Delete the container: docker rm musicbrainz Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your /config folder and settings will be preserved) You can also remove the old dangling images: docker image prune Via Watchtower auto-updater (only use if you don't remember the original parameters) Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one run: docker run --rm \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ containrrr/watchtower \\ --run-once musicbrainz You can also remove the old dangling images: docker image prune Note: We do not endorse the use of Watchtower as a solution to automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact we generally discourage automated updates. However, this is a useful tool for one-time manual updates of containers where you have forgotten the original parameters. In the long term, we highly recommend using Docker Compose . Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier) We recommend Diun for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported. Building locally If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic: git clone https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-musicbrainz.git cd docker-musicbrainz docker build \\ --no-cache \\ --pull \\ -t lscr.io/linuxserver/musicbrainz:latest . The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using multiarch/qemu-user-static docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with -f Dockerfile.aarch64 .

Even Better , you should never even trust our Docker image for generating a private key and open block. Do it on an airgapped machine and keep it on a paper wallet. RPC Proxy settings By default this container will enable RPC control and publish a custom service that acts as an RPC firewall giving you the ability to whitelist specific RPC calls and overide/add default values. The default proxy config is stored in /config/rpc-proxy.json : { \"port\":3000, \"httpsport\":3001, \"rpchost\":\"127.0.0.1\", \"rpcport\":7076, \"certfile\":\"/config/ssl/cert.crt\", \"keyfile\":\"/config/ssl/cert.key\", \"whitelist\":[ \"account_info\", \"account_history\", \"block_count\", \"block_info\", \"pending\", \"process\" ], \"overrides\":{ \"account-history\":{ \"count\":\"64\" }, \"pending\":{ \"count\":\"8\" } } } This should be a minimal amount of RPC access needed to run a local light wallet against this endpoint. If you plan on having your network users only run clientside light wallets (local blake2b block generation and block process call publishing) you should publically publish this port for access for both port 7076 and 7077. For functional light wallets on Https endpoints we will generate a self signed cert/key combo but you should add the ones associated with your domain. This will allow yours and other https hosted light wallets to hit your RPC endpoint clientside from the users web browser. Outside of potential https tunneling and actual object parsing (will remove duplicate keys) this is not a conventional API, it simply acts as a firewall and will send and return data just like a local RPC server would. The goal is to be compatible with any existing Nano software if the developers decide to add the ability to connect to alternative network endpoints. Our Proxy has not been audited by any security team and is provided as is, though we make the best effort to keep it simple and secure Node configuration via environment Before you get started please review the configuration docs here We will pass the CLI_OPTIONS to the node, here is a run command example: -e CLI_OPTIONS='--config node.preconfigured_peers=[\"peering.yourhost.com\",\"peering.yourhost2.com\"] \\ --config node.enable_voting=true' There are many options to know here to run an actual live node especially peering and voting, again please review the docs if you plan to run something outside of a local setup. Quickstart Guide Here we are going to cover the bare minimum commands needed to spinup a local payment network and wallet. First spinup your containers: docker run -d \\ --name node \\ -e CLI_OPTIONS='--config node.enable_voting=true' \\ -p 7076:3000 \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/nano docker run -d \\ --name=wallet \\ -p 80:80 \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/nano-wallet Then unlock the Genesis funds on the local node to allow it to confirm transactions: docker exec -it node bash root@f1df092971f0:/# curl -d '{ \"action\": \"wallet_create\" }' localhost:7076 { \"wallet\": \"A3D63F1B28AC68BCD9E0FF74278C7984A36841C803EF1A81DF92BCD6E3BB18F9\" } root@f1df092971f0:/# curl -d '{ \"action\": \"wallet_add\", \"wallet\": \"A3D63F1B28AC68BCD9E0FF74278C7984A36841C803EF1A81DF92BCD6E3BB18F9\", \"key\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" }' localhost:7076 { \"account\": \"nano_18gmu6engqhgtjnppqam181o5nfhj4sdtgyhy36dan3jr9spt84rzwmktafc\" } Here we are using the default private key of 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for the image. Navigate to http://localhost/#/localhost and enter this key. You should be greeted by the genesis account wallet with 340.28 Million Nano. From here you can generate new wallets from the home screen and send/receive funds on your local network. Now you will be running an insecure centralized network with a single voting representative and a zero security private key using the commands above. To spinup a standard private or even public network you should read up on Nano's documentation HERE and continue reading the network design section below. Network design There are 4 main concepts to grasp from a network standpoint as far as types of endpoints. Before we get started here is a basic network diagram: Principle nodes and voting representatives Principle nodes are network representatives with the ability to vote due to having a certain threshold of funds unlocked on that node or pointed to that unlocked address. These nodes should be as airgapped as possible while still being an active 24/7 peer of the network. From a tecnical perspective this is a node with an account private key that either has the funds it needs itself or enough users have pointed their accounts to it as a representative. In a live and secure configuration to protect the funds of this account you would use an inactive private key account with the funds in it and locally sign a change of representative block to point to the always online representative. These nodes should never process external RPC calls even on a local network, the same rules go for any node with a local unlocked wallet. Keep in mind the key to the security of the network is that 51% of the funds are pointed to trusted representatives that will generally not argue about chain forks. In most deployments the best bet is to heavily centralize your voting nodes, this is unless you are intentionally trying to build a distributed ledger and security model like the main Nano live net. Achieving that will be a long and difficult task. Network peers To a normal user simply transacting on the network using off the shelf tools like a web wallet and web based block explorers is generally all that is required. They get a number in a ledger somewhere and are able to locally sign and publish blocks using their private key using your published RPC endpoints. For advanced users and just to generally make the network more robust, network operators should promote people running their own nodes. Using this image a network peer simply needs to run a docker run command with your pre-configured variables. IE given the generation example from above in the Your Genesis account section: docker create \\ --name=nano \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e PEER_HOST=peering.mydomain.com \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_PUB=2D057DF2EB09E918D3F95B5FCA69A5FD3EA406EF7D1810106324CD7A99FAA32D \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_ACCOUNT=nano_1da7hqsgp4hb55bzkptzsbntdzbyni5gyzar41a88b8fhcezoasfjkgmyk5y \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_WORK=7fd88e48684600b7 \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_SIG=D1DF3A64BB43C131944401632215569A40AAE858ACF6CB59D5C77070E69DBF6435D93807877628A8B142DBF1AC4C562CD2F4CEBEB7D15486BDB7494A6146E007 \\ -p 8075:8075 \\ -p 7076:3000 \\ -p 7077:3001 \\ -v /path/to/data:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/nano When the container spins up it will reach out to the node to bootstrap it's local ledger from peering.mydomain.com . This node once fully synced will be able to run local RPC commands to plug into a wallet and default Nano node wallet commands for automated pocketing of transactions etc. It will also get a list of other peers on the network from it's initial network peering and start participating in your distributed cryptocurrency network. Public RPC endpoints The key to users going to a webpage and managing the funds on your network is the ability to get blockchain information and publish new blocks to theirs. As mentioned earlier we bundle a basic firewall with a core set of RPC functions whitelisted that should be safe to expose publically. From a network design perspective these nodes should be purely what you would consider client peers and never have any wallets registered or private keys stored on them. Also for redundancy optmimally these peers should be run in a cluster behind a load balancer. For standard nodes you are building out a large P2P network, but in the case of the RPC endpoint and specifically the URL the end user is going to pass when accessing their wallet it is up to you to make that resilient. Clientside javascript wallet Currently we publish a pure javascript clientside wallet located here: https://github.com/linuxserver/nano-wallet It is designed to be run 100% clientside in any web browser and use public RPC endpoints to hook into any network and conduct transactions by locally signing then publishing the result. This can be hosted locally with any simple webserver and pointed to a locally run peer, but for full functionality we reccomend providing a public Https URL with these files along with plugging in legitamite SSL certificates into your RPC endpoints running on 7077. Running a node on the LinuxServer network We maintain our own network which users can get funds to transact on from our Discord server. If you would like to run a node on our network here is our Docker run command: docker create \\ --name=lsio-node \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e PEER_HOST=peering.linuxserver.io \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_PUB=79F2E157B5667F1C8B6CCB6DF691DAC032B85DEC39E231D29976DCED05F5B1BE \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_ACCOUNT=nano_1yhkw7ducsmz5k7pskufytaxoi3kq3gyrgh489bbkxpwxn4zdefyn4rmrrkk \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_WORK=c51204c6b69384cb \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_SIG=90DDE7B4DC038811180FF5DDE8594F1774542A7AADE3DB71A57AA38A5AED42672E1E8D7ACFAC315BDB0EB5DCB542C610B9C49B2560AE575073855259AF065509 \\ -p 8075:8075 \\ -p 7076:3000 \\ -p 7077:3001 \\ -v /path/to/data:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/nano Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: nano: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nano:latest container_name: nano environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - PEER_HOST=localhost #optional - LIVE_GENESIS_PUB=GENESIS_PUBLIC #optional - LIVE_GENESIS_ACCOUNT=nano_xxxxxx #optional - LIVE_GENESIS_WORK=WORK_FOR_BLOCK #optional - LIVE_GENESIS_SIG=BLOCK_SIGNATURE #optional - CLI_OPTIONS=--config node.enable_voting=true #optional - LMDB_BOOTSTRAP_URL=http://example.com/Nano_64_version_20.7z #optional volumes: - /path/to/data:/config ports: - 8075:8075 - 7076:3000 - 7077:3001 restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=nano \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e PEER_HOST=localhost `#optional` \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_PUB=GENESIS_PUBLIC `#optional` \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_ACCOUNT=nano_xxxxxx `#optional` \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_WORK=WORK_FOR_BLOCK `#optional` \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_SIG=BLOCK_SIGNATURE `#optional` \\ -e CLI_OPTIONS=--config node.enable_voting=true `#optional` \\ -e LMDB_BOOTSTRAP_URL=http://example.com/Nano_64_version_20.7z `#optional` \\ -p 8075:8075 \\ -p 7076:3000 \\ -p 7077:3001 \\ -v /path/to/data:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/nano:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

IE given the generation example from above in the Your Genesis account section: docker create \\ --name=nano \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e PEER_HOST=peering.mydomain.com \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_PUB=2D057DF2EB09E918D3F95B5FCA69A5FD3EA406EF7D1810106324CD7A99FAA32D \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_ACCOUNT=nano_1da7hqsgp4hb55bzkptzsbntdzbyni5gyzar41a88b8fhcezoasfjkgmyk5y \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_WORK=7fd88e48684600b7 \\ -e LIVE_GENESIS_SIG=D1DF3A64BB43C131944401632215569A40AAE858ACF6CB59D5C77070E69DBF6435D93807877628A8B142DBF1AC4C562CD2F4CEBEB7D15486BDB7494A6146E007 \\ -p 8075:8075 \\ -p 7076:3000 \\ -p 7077:3001 \\ -v /path/to/data:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ linuxserver/nano When the container spins up it will reach out to the node to bootstrap it's local ledger from peering.mydomain.com . This node once fully synced will be able to run local RPC commands to plug into a wallet and default Nano node wallet commands for automated pocketing of transactions etc. It will also get a list of other peers on the network from it's initial network peering and start participating in your distributed cryptocurrency network.","title":"Network peers"},{"location":"images/docker-nano/#public-rpc-endpoints","text":"The key to users going to a webpage and managing the funds on your network is the ability to get blockchain information and publish new blocks to theirs. As mentioned earlier we bundle a basic firewall with a core set of RPC functions whitelisted that should be safe to expose publically. From a network design perspective these nodes should be purely what you would consider client peers and never have any wallets registered or private keys stored on them. Also for redundancy optmimally these peers should be run in a cluster behind a load balancer.

Through Nextcloud you also access, sync and share your existing data on that FTP drive at the office, a Dropbox or a NAS you have at home. Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Version Tags This image provides various versions that are available via tags. Please read the descriptions carefully and exercise caution when using unstable or development tags. Tag Available Description latest \u2705 Stable Nextcloud releases Application Setup Access the webui at https://<your-ip>:443 , for more information check out Nextcloud . Docker image update and recreation of container alone won't update nextcloud version. In order to update nextcloud version, you have two options, firstly make sure you are using the latest docker image,then either Perform the in app gui update. Use the CLI version by running docker exec -it nextcloud updater.phar (Both of these are described here ) Note: Both occ and updater.phar can be run without prepending with sudo -u abc php or sudo -u www-data php If you are not customizing our default nginx configuration you will need to remove the file: /config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf Then restart the container to replace it with the latest one. Collaborative Editing Nextcloud's built-in collaborative editing packages (Collabora/CODE and OnlyOffice) only work on x86_64 systems with glibc, and therefore they are not compatible with our images. You should create separate containers for them and set them up in Nextcloud with their respective connector addons. If (auto) installed, those built-in packages may cause instability and should be removed. Strict reverse proxies This image uses a self-signed certificate by default. This naturally means the scheme is https . If you are using a reverse proxy which validates certificates, you need to disable this check for the container . Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - /path/to/appdata:/config - /path/to/data:/data ports: - 443:443 restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=nextcloud \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -p 443:443 \\ -v /path/to/appdata:/config \\ -v /path/to/data:/data \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

Giving ssh access via private key often means giving full access to the server. This container creates a limited and sandboxed environment that others can ssh into.

If not, the keys can manually be added to /config/.ssh/authorized_keys and the container should be restarted. Removing PUBLIC_KEY or PUBLIC_KEY_FILE variables from docker run environment variables will not remove the keys from authorized_keys . PUBLIC_KEY_FILE and PUBLIC_KEY_DIR can be used with docker secrets. We provide the ability to set and allow password based access via the PASSWORD_ACCESS and USER_PASSWORD variables, though we as an organization discourage using password auth for public facing ssh endpoints. Connect to server via ssh -i /path/to/private/key -p PORT USER_NAME@SERVERIP Setting SUDO_ACCESS to true by itself will allow passwordless sudo. USER_PASSWORD and USER_PASSWORD_FILE allow setting an optional sudo password. The users only have access to the folders mapped and the processes running inside this container. Add any volume mappings you like for the users to have access to. To install packages or services for users to access, use the LinuxServer container customization methods described in this blog article . Sample use case is when a server admin would like to have automated incoming backups from a remote server to the local server, but they might not want all the other admins of the remote server to have full access to the local server. This container can be set up with a mounted folder for incoming backups, and rsync installed via LinuxServer container customization described above, so that the incoming backups can proceed, but remote server and its admins' access would be limited to the backup folder. It is also possible to run multiple copies of this container with different ports mapped, different folders mounted and access to different private keys for compartmentalized access. TIPS You can volume map your own text file to /etc/motd to override the message displayed upon connection. You can optionally set the docker argument hostname Key Generation This container has a helper script to generate an ssh private/public key. In order to generate a key please run: docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /keygen.sh linuxserver/openssh-server Then simply follow the prompts. The keys generated by this script are only displayed on your console output, so make sure to save them somewhere after generation.

USER_PASSWORD and USER_PASSWORD_FILE allow setting an optional sudo password. The users only have access to the folders mapped and the processes running inside this container. Add any volume mappings you like for the users to have access to. To install packages or services for users to access, use the LinuxServer container customization methods described in this blog article . Sample use case is when a server admin would like to have automated incoming backups from a remote server to the local server, but they might not want all the other admins of the remote server to have full access to the local server. This container can be set up with a mounted folder for incoming backups, and rsync installed via LinuxServer container customization described above, so that the incoming backups can proceed, but remote server and its admins' access would be limited to the backup folder. It is also possible to run multiple copies of this container with different ports mapped, different folders mounted and access to different private keys for compartmentalized access.","title":"Application Setup"},{"location":"images/docker-openssh-server/#tips","text":"You can volume map your own text file to /etc/motd to override the message displayed upon connection.

The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Tag x86-64 latest Version Tags This image provides various versions that are available via tags. latest tag usually provides the latest stable version. Others are considered under development and caution must be exercised when using them. Tag Description latest DEPRECATED, no longer updated - Stable releases based on ubuntu bionic xenial DEPRECATED, no longer updated - Stable releases based on ubuntu xenial Application Setup The admin interface is available at https://DOCKER-HOST-IP:943/admin (assuming bridge mode) with a default user/password of admin/password During first login, make sure that the \"Authentication\" in the webui is set to \"Local\" instead of \"PAM\". Then set up the user accounts with their passwords (user accounts created under PAM do not survive container update or recreation). The \"admin\" account is a system (PAM) account and after container update or recreation, its password reverts back to the default. It is highly recommended to block this user's access for security reasons: 1) Create another user and set as an admin, 2) Log in as the new user, 3) Delete the \"admin\" user in the gui, 4) Modify the as.conf file under config/etc and replace the line boot_pam_users.0=admin with ~~ #boot_pam_users.0=admin ~~ boot_pam_users.0=kjhvkhv (this only has to be done once and will survive container recreation) * IMPORTANT NOTE: Commenting out the first pam user in as.conf creates issues in 2.7.5. To make it work while still blocking pam user access, uncomment that line and change admin to a random nonexistent user as described above. To ensure your devices can connect to your VPN properly, goto Configuration -> Network Settings -> and change the \"Hostname or IP Address\" section to either your domain name or public ip address.

If not, you can access the webui at http://<your-ip>:3000 . For github integration, drop your ssh key in to /config/.ssh . Then open a terminal from the top menu and set your github username and email via the following commands git config --global user.name \"username\" git config --global user.email \"email address\" When reverse proxied through SWAG, custom services running on specific ports inside openvscode-server can be accessed at https://PORT.openvscode-server.domain.com very much like how code-server's port proxy function is handled. For that, a wildcard CNAME *.openvscode-server.domain.com needs to be created and the SWAG cert needs to cover those subdomains. Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: openvscode-server: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/openvscode-server:latest container_name: openvscode-server environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - CONNECTION_TOKEN= #optional - CONNECTION_SECRET= #optional - SUDO_PASSWORD=password #optional - SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH= #optional volumes: - /path/to/appdata/config:/config ports: - 3000:3000 restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=openvscode-server \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e CONNECTION_TOKEN= `#optional` \\ -e CONNECTION_SECRET= `#optional` \\ -e SUDO_PASSWORD=password `#optional` \\ -e SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH= `#optional` \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -v /path/to/appdata/config:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/openvscode-server:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 3000 Web UI port. Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use. CONNECTION_TOKEN= Optional security token for accessing the Web UI (ie. supersecrettoken ). CONNECTION_SECRET= Optional path to a file inside the container that contains the security token for accessing the Web UI (ie. /path/to/file ). Overrides CONNECTION_TOKEN . SUDO_PASSWORD=password If this optional variable is set, user will have sudo access in the openvscode-server terminal with the specified password. SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH= Optionally set sudo password via hash (takes priority over SUDO_PASSWORD var). Format is $type$salt$hashed . Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Contains all relevant configuration files. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

The method used depends on how the reader is recognized. The first is /dev/ttyUSBX. To find the correct device, connect the reader and run dmesg | tail on the host. In the output you will find /dev/ttyUSBX, where X is the number of the device. If this is the first reader you connect to your host, it will be /dev/ttyUSB0. If you add one more it will be /dev/ttyUSB1. If there are no /dev/ttyUSBX device in dmesg | tail , you have to use the USB bus path. It will look similar to the below. /dev/bus/usb/001/001 The important parts are the two numbers in the end. The first one is the Bus number, the second is the Device number. To find the Bus and Device number you have to run lsusb on the host, then find your USB device in the list and note the Bus and Device numbers. Here is an example of how to find the Bus and Device. The output of the lsusb command is below. Bus 002 Device 005: ID 076b:6622 OmniKey AG CardMan 6121 The first number, the Bus, is 002. The second number, the Device, is 005. This will look like below in the --device= tag. --device=/dev/bus/usb/002/005 If you have multiple smart card readers, you add one --device= tag for each reader. Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 8888 WebUI Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Where oscam should store config files and logs. Device Mappings ( --device ) Parameter Function /dev/ttyUSB0 For passing through smart card readers. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file.

The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Application Setup On first run create an admin account, any folder and its subfolders that you map to /Pictures will be presented as a webgallery. Config settings are persistent and stored as a subfolder of the /Thumbs mapping. Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: photoshow: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/photoshow:latest container_name: photoshow environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London volumes: - <path to data>:/config - <path to pictures>:/Pictures:ro - <path to store thumbs>:/Thumbs ports: - 80:80 restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=photoshow \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -p 80:80 \\ -v <path to data>:/config \\ -v <path to pictures>:/Pictures:ro \\ -v <path to store thumbs>:/Thumbs \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/photoshow:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 80 WebUI Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Stores config and logs for nginx base. /Pictures:ro Your local folder of photos you wish to share. /Thumbs Local folder to store thumbnails of your images. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Version Tags This image provides various versions that are available via tags. Please read the descriptions carefully and exercise caution when using unstable or development tags. Tag Available Description latest \u2705 Stable releases. develop \u2705 Latest commits from the develop branch Application Setup There is a walkthrough available to help get you up and running. This image supports all of the environment variables listed here and all commandline arguments. To perform a one-time run use docker run (or docker-compose run ) with the --rm and -e PMM_RUN=True arguments. This will cause the container to process your config immediately instead of waiting for the scheduled time, and delete the old container after completion. For more information see the official wiki . Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: plex-meta-manager: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex-meta-manager:latest container_name: plex-meta-manager environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - PMM_CONFIG=/config/config.yml #optional - PMM_TIME=03:00 #optional - PMM_RUN=False #optional - PMM_TEST=False #optional - PMM_NO_MISSING=False #optional volumes: - /path/to/appdata/config:/config restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=plex-meta-manager \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e PMM_CONFIG=/config/config.yml `#optional` \\ -e PMM_TIME=03:00 `#optional` \\ -e PMM_RUN=False `#optional` \\ -e PMM_TEST=False `#optional` \\ -e PMM_NO_MISSING=False `#optional` \\ -v /path/to/appdata/config:/config \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/plex-meta-manager:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London.

PMM_NO_MISSING=False Set to True to run without any of the missing movie/show functions. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Local path for plex-meta-manager config files. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

Hardware Acceleration Intel Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container: --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device. Nvidia Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ).

You can switch to Pydio Cells instead. You must create a user and database for pydio to use in a mysql/mariadb or postgresql server. You can use sqlite with no further config needed, but this should only be considered for testing purposes. In the setup page for database, use the ip address rather than hostname... Self-signed keys are generated the first time you run the container and can be found in /config/keys , if needed, you can replace them with your own. For public link sharing to function correctly be sure to change the Detected Server Url to the URL of your pydio instance in the setup wizard. For email settings edit the file /config/ssmtp.conf and restart the container. Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

To keep packages up to date instead use Ubuntu's own apt, Alpine's apk, Fedora's dnf, or Arch's pacman program You will need a Remote Desktop client to access this container Wikipedia List , by default it listens on 3389, but you can change that port to whatever you wish on the host side IE 3390:3389 . The first thing you should do when you login to the container is to change the abc users password by issuing the passwd command. Modern GUI desktop apps (including some flavors terminals) have issues with the latest Docker and syscall compatibility, you can use Docker with the --security-opt seccomp=unconfined setting to allow these syscalls or try podman as they have updated their codebase to support them If you ever lose your password you can always reset it by execing into the container as root: docker exec -it rdesktop passwd abc By default we perform all logic for the abc user and we reccomend using that user only in the container, but new users can be added as long as there is a startwm.sh executable script in their home directory. All of these containers are configured with passwordless sudo, we make no efforts to secure or harden these containers and we do not reccomend ever publishing their ports to the public Internet. Hardware Acceleration (Ubuntu Container Only) Many desktop application will need access to a GPU to function properly and even some Desktop Environments have compisitor effects that will not function without a GPU. This is not a hard requirement and all base images will function without a video device mounted into the container. Intel/ATI/AMD To leverage hardware acceleration you will need to mount /dev/dri video device inside of the conainer. --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device. Nvidia Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the container. Arm Devices Best effort is made to install tools to allow mounting in /dev/dri on Arm devices. In most cases if /dev/dri exists on the host it should just work. If running a Raspberry Pi 4 be sure to enable dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d in your usercfg.txt.

Scrutiny is a Hard Drive Health Dashboard & Monitoring solution, merging manufacturer provided S.M.A.R.T metrics with real-world failure rates from Backblaze. Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/scrutiny:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

Use the environment variables SCRUTINY_WEB and SCRUTINY_COLLECTOR to control the mode of the container. Setting both to true will deploy the container as both a collector and the web UI - this is the simplest and most straightforward deployment approach. To make use of the hub and spoke model, run this container in \"collector\" mode by specifying SCRUTINY_API_ENDPOINT . Set this to the host that is running the API. For this to work, you will need to expose the API port directly from the container (by default this is 8080 ). You may need to manually enter the container to run scrutiny-collector-metrics run for your first job or wait until around midnight for it to kick off. A fully commented example configuration yaml file can be found in the original project repository here . Place this file in the location mounted to /config .

It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention. Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/swag:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Application Setup Validation and initial setup Before running this container, make sure that the url and subdomains are properly forwarded to this container's host, and that port 443 (and/or 80) is not being used by another service on the host (NAS gui, another webserver, etc.). If you need a dynamic dns provider, you can use the free provider duckdns.org where the URL will be yoursubdomain.duckdns.org and the SUBDOMAINS can be www,ftp,cloud with http validation, or wildcard with dns validation. You can use our duckdns image to update your IP on duckdns.org. For http validation, port 80 on the internet side of the router should be forwarded to this container's port 80 For dns validation, make sure to enter your credentials into the corresponding ini (or json for some plugins) file under /config/dns-conf Cloudflare provides free accounts for managing dns and is very easy to use with this image. Make sure that it is set up for \"dns only\" instead of \"dns + proxy\" Google dns plugin is meant to be used with \"Google Cloud DNS\", a paid enterprise product, and not for \"Google Domains DNS\" DuckDNS only supoprts two types of DNS validated certificates (not both at the same time): Certs that only cover your main subdomain (ie. yoursubdomain.duckdns.org , leave the SUBDOMAINS variable empty) Certs that cover sub-subdomains of your main subdomain (ie. *.yoursubdomain.duckdns.org , set the SUBDOMAINS variable to wildcard ) --cap-add=NET_ADMIN is required for fail2ban to modify iptables After setup, navigate to https://yourdomain.url to access the default homepage (http access through port 80 is disabled by default, you can enable it by editing the default site config at /config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf ). Certs are checked nightly and if expiration is within 30 days, renewal is attempted. If your cert is about to expire in less than 30 days, check the logs under /config/log/letsencrypt to see why the renewals have been failing. It is recommended to input your e-mail in docker parameters so you receive expiration notices from Let's Encrypt in those circumstances. Security and password protection The container detects changes to url and subdomains, revokes existing certs and generates new ones during start. Per RFC7919 , the container is shipping ffdhe4096 as the dhparams.pem . If you'd like to password protect your sites, you can use htpasswd. Run the following command on your host to generate the htpasswd file docker exec -it swag htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd <username> You can add multiple user:pass to .htpasswd . For the first user, use the above command, for others, use the above command without the -c flag, as it will force deletion of the existing .htpasswd and creation of a new one You can also use ldap auth for security and access control. A sample, user configurable ldap.conf is provided, and it requires the separate image linuxserver/ldap-auth to communicate with an ldap server. Site config and reverse proxy The default site config resides at /config/nginx/site-confs/default.conf . Feel free to modify this file, and you can add other conf files to this directory. However, if you delete the default file, a new default will be created on container start. Preset reverse proxy config files are added for popular apps. See the README.md file under /config/nginx/proxy_confs for instructions on how to enable them. The preset confs reside in and get imported from this repo . If you wish to hide your site from search engine crawlers, you may find it useful to add this configuration line to your site config, within the server block, above the line where ssl.conf is included add_header X-Robots-Tag \"noindex, nofollow, nosnippet, noarchive\"; This will ask Google et al not to index and list your site. Be careful with this, as you will eventually be de-listed if you leave this line in on a site you wish to be present on search engines If you wish to redirect http to https, you must expose port 80 Using certs in other containers This container includes auto-generated pfx and private-fullchain-bundle pem certs that are needed by other apps like Emby and Znc. To use these certs in other containers, do either of the following: (Easier) Mount the container's config folder in other containers (ie. -v /path-to-swag-config:/swag-ssl ) and in the other containers, use the cert location /swag-ssl/keys/letsencrypt/ (More secure) Mount the SWAG folder etc that resides under /config in other containers (ie. -v /path-to-swag-config/etc:/swag-ssl ) and in the other containers, use the cert location /swag-ssl/letsencrypt/live/<your.domain.url>/ (This is more secure because the first method shares the entire SWAG config folder with other containers, including the www files, whereas the second method only shares the ssl certs) These certs include: cert.pem , chain.pem , fullchain.pem and privkey.pem , which are generated by Certbot and used by nginx and various other apps privkey.pfx , a format supported by Microsoft and commonly used by dotnet apps such as Emby Server (no password) priv-fullchain-bundle.pem , a pem cert that bundles the private key and the fullchain, used by apps like ZNC Using fail2ban This container includes fail2ban set up with 5 jails by default: nginx-http-auth nginx-badbots nginx-botsearch nginx-deny nginx-unauthorized To enable or disable other jails, modify the file /config/fail2ban/jail.local To modify filters and actions, instead of editing the .conf files, create .local files with the same name and edit those because .conf files get overwritten when the actions and filters are updated. .local files will append whatever's in the .conf files (ie. nginx-http-auth.conf --> nginx-http-auth.local ) You can check which jails are active via docker exec -it swag fail2ban-client status You can check the status of a specific jail via docker exec -it swag fail2ban-client status <jail name> You can unban an IP via docker exec -it swag fail2ban-client set <jail name> unbanip <IP> A list of commands can be found here: https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Commands Updating configs This container creates a number of configs for nginx, proxy samples, etc. Config updates are noted in the changelog but not automatically applied to your files. If you have modified a file with noted changes in the changelog: Keep your existing configs as is (not broken, don't fix) Review our repository commits and apply the new changes yourself Delete the modified config file with listed updates, restart the container, reapply your changes If you have NOT modified a file with noted changes in the changelog: Delete the config file with listed updates, restart the container Proxy sample updates are not listed in the changelog. See the changes here: https://github.com/linuxserver/reverse-proxy-confs/commits/master Proxy sample files WILL be updated, however your renamed (enabled) proxy files will not. You can check the new sample and adjust your active config as needed. Migration from the old linuxserver/letsencrypt image Please follow the instructions on this blog post .

Stop the container before editing it or any changes won't be saved. If you choose to use transmission-web-control as your default UI, just note that the origional Web UI will not be available to you despite the button being present. Securing the webui with a username/password. Use the USER and PASS variables in docker run/create/compose to set authentication. Do not manually edit the settings.json to input user/pass, otherwise transmission cannot be stopped cleanly by the s6 supervisor. Updating Blocklists Automatically This requires \"blocklist-enabled\": true, to be set. By setting this to true, it is assumed you have also populated blocklist-url with a valid block list. The automatic update is a shell script that downloads a blocklist from the url stored in the settings.json, gunzips it, and restarts the transmission daemon. The automatic update will run once a day at 3am local server time. Using whitelist Use WHITELIST to enable a list of ip as whitelist. This enable support for rpc-whitelist . When WHITELIST is empty support for whitelist is disabled. Use HOST_WHITELIST to enable an list of dns names as host-whitelist. This enable support for rpc-host-whitelist . When HOST_WHITELIST is empty support for host-whitelist is disabled. Use alternative Transmission torrent ports Use PEERPORT to specify the port(s) Transmission should listen on.

Tvheadend offers the HTTP (VLC, MPlayer), HTSP (Kodi, Movian) and SAT>IP streaming. Multiple EPG sources are supported (over-the-air DVB and ATSC including OpenTV DVB extensions, XMLTV, PyXML). Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/tvheadend:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Application Setup The setup depends if you run the one of the stable tags or use latest. Running latest is the easiest as it has a setup wizard. Stable First thing to do is to go to Configuration --> DVB Inputs --> TV adapters and add your LNB/switch info. Then create a new network in the Networks tab and set the correct pre-defined muxes and orbital position. Go back to the TV adapters tab and add the newly created network under universal LNB. Go back to the Networks tab and mark the network you created earlier and press the Force Scan button. Tvheadend will now scan the muxes for services. After the scan is done, head to the Services tab and find the services you want as channels, mark them, and press map services. They should now appear under Configuration --> Channel/EPG. Latest The first thing to do is to run the setup wizard. If it doesn't pop up at first login, you can find it in Configuration --> General --> Base and click Start Wizard. This will guide you to set up the basic parts of tvheadend. Configuring XMLTV grabber To configure the XMLTV grabber, first check if your grabber is listed in Configuration --> Channel/EPG --> EPG Grabber Modules. If it's listed, you will have to configure the grabber before enabling. Find the path in the path field of your grabber. We will use the last part. It starts with tv_grab_. Add it after /usr/bin/ in the below command. There should be no space between Usr/bin/ and the part you added. docker exec -it -u abc tvheadend /usr/bin/for_you_to_fill_out --configure Now follow the onscreen progress. If you get asked about cache, just accept the default. After you have configured your grabber, you can go back and enable your grabber. If you allready have a configuration file, you can add it in the .xmltv folder where you mapped the /config volume. If it's not created, create it. Comskip This container comes with Comskip for commercial flagging of recordings. This you have to add in the recording config of tvheadend. Go to Configuration --> Recording. Change the view level to advanced in the top right corner, and add the below in the Post-processor command field. /usr/bin/comskip --ini=/config/comskip/comskip.ini \"%f\" Now comskip will run after each recording is finished. You will find comskip.ini in the comskip folder of your /config volume mapping. See the Comskip homepage for tuning of the ini file. FFmpeg FFmpeg is installed in /usr/bin/ in case you need to use it with pipe. EPG XML file If you have EPG data in XML format from a supplier, you can drop it in the data folder of your /config volume mapping. If it doesn't exist, create it. Then choose the XML file grabber in Configuration --> Channel/EPG --> EPG Grabber Modules. If you use WebGrab+Plus, choose the WebGrab+Plus XML file grabber. The XML file goes in the same path as above. The xml file has to be named guide.xml. For advanced setup of tvheadend, go to [Tvheadend][appurl] Picons We have added all the picons from picons in the folder /picons. To enable the use of these picons, add the path to the Channel icon path in Configuration --> General --> Base. You need to enable minimum advanced view level to see the picons options. Additional runtime parameters In some cases it might be necessary to start tvheadend with additional parameters, for example to enable debugging or specify webroot for reverse proxy. Be sure to have the right parameters set, as adding the wrong once might lead to the container not starting correctly. Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: tvheadend: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/tvheadend:latest container_name: tvheadend environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - RUN_OPTS= #optional volumes: - /path/to/data:/config - /path/to/recordings:/recordings ports: - 9981:9981 - 9982:9982 devices: - /dev/dri:/dev/dri #optional - /dev/dvb:/dev/dvb #optional restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=tvheadend \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e RUN_OPTS= `#optional` \\ -p 9981:9981 \\ -p 9982:9982 \\ -v /path/to/data:/config \\ -v /path/to/recordings:/recordings \\ --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri `#optional` \\ --device /dev/dvb:/dev/dvb `#optional` \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/tvheadend:latest Host vs. Bridge If you use IPTV, SAT>IP or HDHomeRun, you need to create the container with --net=host and remove the -p flags. This is because to work with these services Tvheadend requires a multicast address of 239.255.255.250 and a UDP port of 1900 which at this time is not possible with docker bridge mode. If you have other host services which also use multicast such as SSDP/DLNA/Emby you may experience stabilty problems. These can be solved by giving tvheadend its own IP using macvlan. Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 9981 WebUI 9982 HTSP server port. Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. RUN_OPTS= Optionally specify additional arguments to be passed. See Additional runtime parameters. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Where TVHeadend show store it's config files. /recordings Where you want the PVR to store recordings. Device Mappings ( --device ) Parameter Function /dev/dri Only needed if you want to use your AMD/Intel GPU for hardware accelerated video encoding (vaapi). /dev/dvb Only needed if you want to pass through a DVB card to the container. If you use IPTV or HDHomeRun you can leave it out. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID .

Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/unifi-controller:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u274c Application Setup The webui is at https://ip:8443, setup with the first run wizard. For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System Settings > Controller Configuration and set the Controller Hostname/IP to a hostname or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox \"Override inform host with controller hostname/IP\" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption). In order to manually adopt a device take these steps: ssh ubnt@$AP-IP set-inform http://$address:8080/inform The default device password is ubnt . $address is the IP address of the host you are running this container on and $AP-IP is the Access Point IP address. When using a Security Gateway (router) it could be that network connected devices are unable to obtain an ip address. This can be fixed by setting \"DHCP Gateway IP\", under Settings > Networks > network_name, to a correct (and accessable) ip address. Strict reverse proxies This image uses a self-signed certificate by default. This naturally means the scheme is https . If you are using a reverse proxy which validates certificates, you need to disable this check for the container .

For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System Settings > Controller Configuration and set the Controller Hostname/IP to a hostname or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox \"Override inform host with controller hostname/IP\" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption). In order to manually adopt a device take these steps: ssh ubnt@$AP-IP set-inform http://$address:8080/inform The default device password is ubnt . $address is the IP address of the host you are running this container on and $AP-IP is the Access Point IP address. When using a Security Gateway (router) it could be that network connected devices are unable to obtain an ip address. This can be fixed by setting \"DHCP Gateway IP\", under Settings > Networks > network_name, to a correct (and accessable) ip address.","title":"Application Setup"},{"location":"images/docker-unifi-controller/#strict-reverse-proxies","text":"This image uses a self-signed certificate by default.

You can access advanced features of the Guacamole remote desktop using ctrl+alt+shift enabling you to use remote copy/paste, an onscreen keyboard, or a baked in file manager. This can also be accessed by clicking the small circle on the left side of the screen. Modern GUI desktop apps (including some flavors terminals) have issues with the latest Docker and syscall compatibility, you can use Docker with the --security-opt seccomp=unconfined setting to allow these syscalls or try podman as they have updated their codebase to support them Unlike our other containers these Desktops are not designed to be upgraded by Docker, you will keep your home directoy but anything you installed system level will be lost if you upgrade an existing container. To keep packages up to date instead use Ubuntu's own apt, Alpine's apk, Fedora's dnf, or Arch's pacman program Keyboard Layouts This should match the layout on the computer you are accessing the container from. The keyboard layouts available for use are: * da-dk-qwerty- Danish keyboard * de-ch-qwertz- Swiss German keyboard (qwertz) * de-de-qwertz- German keyboard (qwertz) - OSK available * en-gb-qwerty- English (UK) keyboard * en-us-qwerty- English (US) keyboard - OSK available DEFAULT * es-es-qwerty- Spanish keyboard - OSK available * fr-ch-qwertz- Swiss French keyboard (qwertz) * fr-fr-azerty- French keyboard (azerty) - OSK available * it-it-qwerty- Italian keyboard - OSK available * ja-jp-qwerty- Japanese keyboard * pt-br-qwerty- Portuguese Brazilian keyboard * sv-se-qwerty- Swedish keyboard * tr-tr-qwerty- Turkish-Q keyboard If you ever lose your password you can always reset it by execing into the container as root: docker exec -it webtop passwd abc By default we perform all logic for the abc user and we reccomend using that user only in the container, but new users can be added as long as there is a startwm.sh executable script in their home directory. All of these containers are configured with passwordless sudo, we make no efforts to secure or harden these containers and we do not reccomend ever publishing their ports to the public Internet. Hardware Acceleration (Ubuntu Container Only) Many desktop application will need access to a GPU to function properly and even some Desktop Environments have compisitor effects that will not function without a GPU. This is not a hard requirement and all base images will function without a video device mounted into the container. Intel/ATI/AMD To leverage hardware acceleration you will need to mount /dev/dri video device inside of the conainer. --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device. Nvidia Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime --runtime=nvidia and add an environment variable -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the container. Arm Devices Best effort is made to install tools to allow mounting in /dev/dri on Arm devices. In most cases if /dev/dri exists on the host it should just work. If running a Raspberry Pi 4 be sure to enable dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d in your usercfg.txt. Usage To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli. docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info ) --- version: \"2.1\" services: webtop: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/webtop:latest container_name: webtop security_opt: - seccomp:unconfined #optional environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - SUBFOLDER=/ #optional - KEYBOARD=en-us-qwerty #optional - TITLE=Webtop #optional volumes: - /path/to/data:/config - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock #optional ports: - 3000:3000 devices: - /dev/dri:/dev/dri #optional shm_size: \"1gb\" #optional restart: unless-stopped docker cli ( click here for more info ) docker run -d \\ --name=webtop \\ --security-opt seccomp=unconfined `#optional` \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e SUBFOLDER=/ `#optional` \\ -e KEYBOARD=en-us-qwerty `#optional` \\ -e TITLE=Webtop `#optional` \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -v /path/to/data:/config \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `#optional` \\ --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri `#optional` \\ --shm-size=\"1gb\" `#optional` \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/webtop:latest Parameters Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 3000 Web Desktop GUI Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London SUBFOLDER=/ Specify a subfolder to use with reverse proxies, IE /subfolder/ KEYBOARD=en-us-qwerty See the keyboard layouts section for more information and options. TITLE=Webtop String which will be used as page/tab title in the web browser. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config abc users home directory /var/run/docker.sock Docker Socket on the system, if you want to use Docker in the container Device Mappings ( --device ) Parameter Function /dev/dri Add this for GL support (Linux hosts only) Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function --shm-size= We set this to 1 gig to prevent modern web browsers from crashing --security-opt seccomp=unconfined For Docker Engine only, many modern gui apps need this to function on older hosts as syscalls are unknown to Docker. Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file. Umask for running applications For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional -e UMASK=022 setting. Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up here before asking for support. User / Group Identifiers When using volumes ( -v flags), permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID . Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic. In this instance PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 , to find yours use id user as below: $ id username uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup) Docker Mods We publish various Docker Mods to enable additional functionality within the containers.

It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry. Supported Architectures We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker here and our announcement here . Simply pulling lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard:latest should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags. The architectures supported by this image are: Architecture Available Tag x86-64 \u2705 amd64-\\<version tag> arm64 \u2705 arm64v8-\\<version tag> armhf \u2705 arm32v7-\\<version tag> Version Tags This image provides various versions that are available via tags. Please read the descriptions carefully and exercise caution when using unstable or development tags. Tag Available Description latest \u2705 Stable releases with support for compiling Wireguard modules alpine \u2705 Stable releases based on Alpine without support for compiling Wireguard modules Application Setup During container start, it will first check if the wireguard module is already installed and loaded. Kernels newer than 5.6 generally have the wireguard module built-in (along with some older custom kernels). However, the module may not be enabled. Make sure it is enabled prior to starting the container. If the kernel is not built-in, or installed on host, the container will check if the kernel headers are present (in /usr/src ) and if not, it will attempt to download the necessary kernel headers from the ubuntu xenial/bionic , debian/raspbian buster repos; then will attempt to compile and install the kernel module. If the kernel headers are not found in either usr/src or in the repos mentioned, container will sleep indefinitely as wireguard cannot be installed. If you're on a debian/ubuntu based host with a custom or downstream distro provided kernel (ie. Pop!_OS), the container won't be able to install the kernel headers from the regular ubuntu and debian repos. In those cases, you can try installing the headers on the host via sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) (if distro version) and then add a volume mapping for /usr/src:/usr/src , or if custom built, map the location of the existing headers to allow the container to use host installed headers to build the kernel module (tested successful on Pop!_OS, ymmv). With regards to arm32/64 devices, Raspberry Pi 2-4 running the official ubuntu images or Raspbian Buster are supported out of the box. For all other devices and OSes, you can try installing the kernel headers on the host, and mapping /usr/src:/usr/src and it may just work (no guarantees). This can be run as a server or a client, based on the parameters used. Server Mode If the environment variable PEERS is set to a number or a list of strings separated by comma, the container will run in server mode and the necessary server and peer/client confs will be generated. The peer/client config qr codes will be output in the docker log. They will also be saved in text and png format under /config/peerX in case PEERS is a variable and an integer or /config/peer_X in case a list of names was provided instead of an integer. Variables SERVERURL , SERVERPORT , INTERNAL_SUBNET and PEERDNS are optional variables used for server mode. Any changes to these environment variables will trigger regeneration of server and peer confs. Peer/client confs will be recreated with existing private/public keys. Delete the peer folders for the keys to be recreated along with the confs. To add more peers/clients later on, you increment the PEERS environment variable or add more elements to the list and recreate the container. To display the QR codes of active peers again, you can use the following command and list the peer numbers as arguments: docker exec -it wireguard /app/show-peer 1 4 5 or docker exec -it wireguard /app/show-peer myPC myPhone myTablet (Keep in mind that the QR codes are also stored as PNGs in the config folder). The templates used for server and peer confs are saved under /config/templates . Advanced users can modify these templates and force conf generation by deleting /config/wg0.conf and restarting the container. Client Mode Do not set the PEERS environment variable. Drop your client conf into the config folder as /config/wg0.conf and start the container. If you get IPv6 related errors in the log and connection cannot be established, edit the AllowedIPs line in your peer/client wg0.conf to include only 0.0.0.0/0 and not ::/0 ; and restart the container. Road warriors, roaming and returning home If you plan to use Wireguard both remotely and locally, say on your mobile phone, you will need to consider routing. Most firewalls will not route ports forwarded on your WAN interface correctly to the LAN out of the box. This means that when you return home, even though you can see the Wireguard server, the return packets will probably get lost. This is not a Wireguard specific issue and the two generally accepted solutions are NAT reflection (setting your edge router/firewall up in such a way as it translates internal packets correctly) or split horizon DNS (setting your internal DNS to return the private rather than public IP when connecting locally). Both of these approaches have positives and negatives however their setup is out of scope for this document as everyone's network layout and equipment will be different. Maintaining local access to attached services ** Note: This is not a supported configuration by Linuxserver.io - use at your own risk. When routing via Wireguard from another container using the service option in docker, you might lose access to the containers webUI locally. To avoid this, exclude the docker subnet from being routed via Wireguard by modifying your wg0.conf like so (modifying the subnets as you require): ini [Interface] PrivateKey = <private key> Address = 9.8.7.6/32 DNS = 8.8.8.8 PostUp = DROUTE=$(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'); HOMENET=192.168.0.0/16; HOMENET2=10.0.0.0/8; HOMENET3=172.16.0.0/12; ip route add $HOMENET3 via $DROUTE;ip route add $HOMENET2 via $DROUTE; ip route add $HOMENET via $DROUTE;iptables -I OUTPUT -d $HOMENET -j ACCEPT;iptables -A OUTPUT -d $HOMENET2 -j ACCEPT; iptables -A OUTPUT -d $HOMENET3 -j ACCEPT; iptables -A OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT PreDown = HOMENET=192.168.0.0/16; HOMENET2=10.0.0.0/8; HOMENET3=172.16.0.0/12; ip route del $HOMENET3 via $DROUTE;ip route del $HOMENET2 via $DROUTE; ip route del $HOMENET via $DROUTE; iptables -D OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT; iptables -D OUTPUT -d $HOMENET -j ACCEPT; iptables -D OUTPUT -d $HOMENET2 -j ACCEPT; iptables -D OUTPUT -d $HOMENET3 -j ACCEPT Site-to-site VPN ** Note: This is not a supported configuration by Linuxserver.io - use at your own risk. Site-to-site VPN in server mode requires customizing the AllowedIPs statement for a specific peer in wg0.conf . Since wg0.conf is autogenerated when server vars are changed, it is not recommended to edit it manually. In order to customize the AllowedIPs statement for a specific peer in wg0.conf , you can set an env var SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_<peer name or number> to the additional subnets you'd like to add, comma separated and excluding the peer IP (ie. \"192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24\" ). Replace <peer name or number> with either the name or number of a peer (whichever is used in the PEERS var). For instance SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_laptop=\"192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24\" will result in the wg0.conf entry AllowedIPs = 10.13.13.2,192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24 for the peer named laptop . Keep in mind that this var will only be considered when the confs are regenerated. Adding this var for an existing peer won't force a regeneration. You can delete wg0.conf and restart the container to force regeneration if necessary. Don't forget to set the necessary POSTUP and POSTDOWN rules in your client's peer conf for lan access.

These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate <external>:<internal> respectively. For example, -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 outside the container. Ports ( -p ) Parameter Function 51820/udp wireguard port Environment Variables ( -e ) Env Function PUID=1000 for UserID - see below for explanation PGID=1000 for GroupID - see below for explanation TZ=Europe/London Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London SERVERURL=wireguard.domain.com External IP or domain name for docker host. Used in server mode. If set to auto , the container will try to determine and set the external IP automatically SERVERPORT=51820 External port for docker host. Used in server mode. PEERS=1 Number of peers to create confs for. Required for server mode. Can also be a list of names: myPC,myPhone,myTablet (alphanumeric only) PEERDNS=auto DNS server set in peer/client configs (can be set as 8.8.8.8 ). Used in server mode. Defaults to auto , which uses wireguard docker host's DNS via included CoreDNS forward. INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0 Internal subnet for the wireguard and server and peers (only change if it clashes). Used in server mode. ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 The IPs/Ranges that the peers will be able to reach using the VPN connection. If not specified the default value is: '0.0.0.0/0, ::0/0' This will cause ALL traffic to route through the VPN, if you want split tunneling, set this to only the IPs you would like to use the tunnel AND the ip of the server's WG ip, such as 10.13.13.1. LOG_CONFS=true Generated QR codes will be displayed in the docker log. Set to false to skip log output. Volume Mappings ( -v ) Volume Function /config Contains all relevant configuration files. /lib/modules Maps host's modules folder. Only required if compiling wireguard modules. Miscellaneous Options Parameter Function --sysctl= Required for client mode. Portainer notice {% hint style=\"warning\" %} This image utilises cap_add or sysctl to work properly. This is not implemented properly in some versions of Portainer, thus this image may not work if deployed through Portainer. {% endhint %} Environment variables from files (Docker secrets) You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend FILE__ . As an example: -e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword Will set the environment variable PASSWORD based on the contents of the /run/secrets/mysecretpassword file.

In order to customize the AllowedIPs statement for a specific peer in wg0.conf , you can set an env var SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_<peer name or number> to the additional subnets you'd like to add, comma separated and excluding the peer IP (ie. \"192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24\" ). Replace <peer name or number> with either the name or number of a peer (whichever is used in the PEERS var). For instance SERVER_ALLOWEDIPS_PEER_laptop=\"192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24\" will result in the wg0.conf entry AllowedIPs = 10.13.13.2,192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24 for the peer named laptop . Keep in mind that this var will only be considered when the confs are regenerated. Adding this var for an existing peer won't force a regeneration. You can delete wg0.conf and restart the container to force regeneration if necessary. Don't forget to set the necessary POSTUP and POSTDOWN rules in your client's peer conf for lan access.","title":"Site-to-site VPN"},{"location":"images/docker-wireguard/#usage","text":"To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"images/docker-wireguard/#docker-compose-recommended-click-here-for-more-info","text":"--- version: \"2.1\" services: wireguard: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard:latest container_name: wireguard cap_add: - NET_ADMIN - SYS_MODULE environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=Europe/London - SERVERURL=wireguard.domain.com #optional - SERVERPORT=51820 #optional - PEERS=1 #optional - PEERDNS=auto #optional - INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0 #optional - ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 #optional - LOG_CONFS=true #optional volumes: - /path/to/appdata/config:/config - /lib/modules:/lib/modules #optional ports: - 51820:51820/udp sysctls: - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 restart: unless-stopped","title":"docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info)"},{"location":"images/docker-wireguard/#docker-cli-click-here-for-more-info","text":"docker run -d \\ --name=wireguard \\ --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \\ --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \\ -e PUID=1000 \\ -e PGID=1000 \\ -e TZ=Europe/London \\ -e SERVERURL=wireguard.domain.com `#optional` \\ -e SERVERPORT=51820 `#optional` \\ -e PEERS=1 `#optional` \\ -e PEERDNS=auto `#optional` \\ -e INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0 `#optional` \\ -e ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0 `#optional` \\ -e LOG_CONFS=true `#optional` \\ -p 51820:51820/udp \\ -v /path/to/appdata/config:/config \\ -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules `#optional` \\ --sysctl=\"net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1\" \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard:latest","title":"docker cli (click here for more info)"},{"location":"images/docker-wireguard/#parameters","text":"Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).
